<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p>On one occasion, after having had to swallow an exceptionally
large dose of complimentary eloquence, I stated that
I was going to borrow a title for my book from my favorite
philosopher, Mr. Dooley, and call it “Alone in Europe.”</p>

<p>The title that has been given it sounds almost as egoistic
as that; but there will be found in these pages other names
than my own. Indeed, objection may be made from a literary
point of view that the book bristles with names. I could not
write my story otherwise. I knew these men, and what
they did, and my only regret is that I have undoubtedly
overlooked some, especially amongst replacements, whose
names and deeds should be mentioned. Battles are not
fought by commanding officers alone, not even by chaplains
unaided; and the men who do the fighting usually get little
personal credit for their valor.</p>

<p>My chronicle claims no merit save that of being true.
The only critics I had in mind while writing it were those
who fought in France. If they say that the pictures are
true, I am content. The diary style has been deliberately
chosen because it permits the introduction of incidents, and
also lends itself to the telling of a plain unvarnished tale.</p>

<p>Every Regiment in a combat division has a similar story,
if any one of its members has the knowledge and patience
to tell it. “The Irish 69th” had naturally its own special
flavor of race with the buoyant spirits, the military <em>élan</em>,
and the religious ardor that mark the race. No picture of
the regiment would be complete that did not give a generous
place to this phase of its life.</p>

<p>Happily, the Irish spirit has always managed to combine
generous tolerance with its fervors. As a result, there are
no more enthusiastic adherents of the Irish 69th than those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</span>
of its members who did not share in the blood or the creed
of the majority.</p>

<p>As for myself, I liked them all. I am a very Irish, very
Catholic, very American person if anybody challenges my
convictions. But normally, and let alone, I am just plain
human. My appreciation of patriotism, or courage, or any
other attractive human trait, is not limited in any degree by
racial or religious or sectional prejudice. That was the
spirit of our Army; may it always be the spirit of our Republic.</p>

<p>Joyce Kilmer was to have written this book. I took over
the task after his death in battle. The manuscript he left
had been hurriedly written, at intervals in a busy soldier
existence, which interested him far more than literary work.
I have taken the liberty of adding his work, incomplete
though it is, to my own; because I feel that Kilmer would
be glad at having his name associated with the story of the
Regiment which had his absolute devotion; and because I
cannot resist the temptation of associating with my own
the name of one of the noblest specimens of humanity that
has existed in our times.</p>

<p>I wish to thank Major Meaney, Major Bootz, Captain
Allen, Lieutenants Harold Allen and Thomas C. P. Martin,
Sergeant Major O’Connell and the Company Clerks for
data for this book; Sergeant William Halligan, Privates
John F. McLoughlin and Arthur Shea, Mr. Paul Shea,
and Father John B. Kelly for assistance in preparing the
manuscript for publication; and Sergeants T. C. Ranscht
and R. L. Clarke for the maps that appear in this volume.</p>

PREPARATIONS AT HOME</h2>

<p class="center no-indent fs90">RECTORY, CHURCH OF OUR SAVIOUR, BRONX</p>

<p class="right"><em>June</em>, 1917</p>

<p>War with Germany was declared on April 6th, 1917.
Immediately the National Guard Regiments, knowing that
they would be the first to be called from civilian occupations,
began campaigning for recruits. Ours was conducted
with little noise or speech making. An Irish Regiment has
its troubles in time of peace, but when the call to arms
was sounding we knew that if they let us we could easily
offer them an Irish Brigade for the service. We were more
occupied with quality than with numbers. The one bit of
publicity we indulged in was to send round our machine-gun
trucks through the city streets with the placard, “Don’t
join the 69th unless you want to be among the first to go
to France.” That was the only kind of men we wanted—not
impressionable youth who would volunteer under the
stimulus of a brass band or a flood of patriotic oratory.
The old-timers were told to bring in friends who had the
right stuff in them. The Catholic Clergy were asked to
send in good men from the Parish athletic clubs.</p>

<p>The response was immediate. Every night the big reception
rooms were packed with men taking the physical
tests. The medical staff had to be increased at once to meet
the situation and officers and enlisted men were impressed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
into the service for taking the minor tests. These tests
were rigid. Nobody was taken who fell below the standard
in age, height, weight, sight or chest measurement—or
who had liquor aboard or who had not a clean skin. Many
of those who were turned down for underweight or imperfect
feet were readily accepted in other Regiments which
had more difficulty in getting men. And when we received
contingents from those regiments later on I often
had to listen to the humorous reproach, “Well, I got in in
spite of the lot of you.”</p>

<p>Amongst the sturdiest and brightest of our recruits were
two young men who had recently been Jesuit Novices. I
amused one Jesuit friend and, I am afraid, shocked another
by saying that they were exercising a traditional religious
privilege of seeking a higher state of perfection by quitting
the Jesuits and joining the 69th.</p>

<p>We came back from Texas less than a thousand strong.
Of these we could count on 500 for a new war, which left
us 1,500 to go to meet the number then fixed for an Infantry
Regiment—2,002. We were not long in reaching that
number. Lieutenant Colonel Reed telegraphed the War
Department for permission, pending the proposed increase
of a Regiment to 3,600, to establish a waiting list, but the
application was refused. In the latter days we were turning
away 300 a week, sending them to other Regiments.</p>

<p>Our 2,000 men were a picked lot. They came mainly
from Irish County Societies and from Catholic Athletic
Clubs. A number of these latter Irish bore distinctly German,
French, Italian or Polish names. They were Irish by
adoption, Irish by association or Irish by conviction. The
69th never attempted to set up any religious test. It was
an institution offered to the Nation by a people grateful for
liberty, and it always welcomed and made part of it any
American citizen who desired to serve in it. But, naturally,
men of Irish birth or blood were attracted by the traditions
of the 69th, and many Catholics wanted to be with a regiment
where they could be sure of being able to attend to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
their religious duties. About 5 percent of the 2,000 were
Irish neither by race nor racial creed.</p>


<h3>69TH REGIMENT ARMORY</h3>


<p class="right"><em>July</em> 20th, 1917</p>


<p>Frank Ward O’Malley of the New York <cite>Sun</cite> has written
up in his inimitable style a little scene from life in an
Irish regiment. The newcomers are not yet accustomed to
the special church regulations relieving soldiers of the obligation
of Friday abstinence. Last Friday the men came back
from a hard morning’s drill to find on the table a generous
meal of ham and cabbage. The old-timers from the Border
pitched into this, to the scandal of many of the newer men
who refused to eat it, thus leaving all the more for the
graceless veterans. After dinner a number of them came to
me to ask if it were true that it was all right. I said it
was, because there was a dispensation for soldiers. “Dispensation,”
said a Jewish boy, “what good is a dispensation
for Friday to me. I can’t eat ham any day of the week.
Say, Father, that waiter guy, with one turn of his wrist,

<p class="right"><em>July</em> 25th, 1917</p>


<p>A great day for Ireland. Everybody aboard and up the
river to 152nd Street and then to the Polo Grounds. Baseball
Game as benefit for the 69th, between Giants and Cincinnatis,
thanks to the generosity of our good friends,
Harry Hempstead, John Whalen, Herbert Vreeland, and
John J. McGraw. A fine game—plenty of people, plenty
of fun, and best of all, plenty of money for the exchequer,
which, after an ancient venerable custom, is going to have
an ecclesiastical chancellor. Mr. Daniel M. Brady, the Godfather
of the regiment, had procured the signature of
President Wilson on a baseball which he auctioned off during
the game. I asked him if he had arranged for a purchaser.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
“I have selected one,” he said. “Is he aware that
he is going to buy it?” I asked. “He will be informed at
the proper time,” said Mr. Brady with a smile. “How
much is he going to pay for it?” “Well, I don’t consider
$500.00 too much to pay for the privilege.” So after a
certain number of bids, real or fictitious, the ball was
knocked down at $500.00 to Mr. James Butler, who accepted
the verdict smilingly and was allowed the privilege
of handing the ball back to me. I am to auction it in Paris
for the French Orphans’ Fund. So Mr. Brady says,
though I wish I had his confidence that we shall ever get to
Paris.</p>


<h3>ARMORY</h3>


<p class="right"><em>August</em> 5th, 1917</p>


<p>Father John Kelly had me meet Joyce Kilmer this evening.
Nothing of the long-haired variety about him—a
sturdy fellow, manly, humorous, interesting. He was a
little shame-faced at first, for he had told Father Kelly
that he was going to join up with the 69th and he is now
in the 7th. “I went to the Armory twice,” he said, “but
failed to find the recruiting officer.” I told him that if we
could not have him in the 69th the next best place was the
7th, but he still wants to return to his first love, so I shall
be glad to arrange it. If he left the whole matter up to my
decision he would stay home and look after his large family
and let men with fewer responsibilities undertake this task,
at least until such time as the country would have need of
every man. But he is bound to do his share and do it at
once, so there is no use taking off the fine edge of his enthusiasm.
He is going about this thing in exactly the same
spirit that led him to enter the Church. He sees what he
considers a plain duty, and he is going ahead to perform
it, calm and clear eyed and without the slightest regard to
what the consequences may be.</p>

<p>I shall be glad to have him with us personally for the
pleasure of his companionship, and also for the sake of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
regiment to have a poet and historian who will confer upon
us the gift of immortality. I compared him with the old
lad that one lot of Greeks sent to another to stir them to
victory by his songs; and he wagged a pair of vigorous
protesting legs at me to show he was no cripple. So I tried
him with a quotation from a poet that no poet could ever
resist; and with some reservations about the words “Grey
Bard” I managed to drive my compliment home:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">For not to have been dipt in Lethe’s lake</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Could make the son of Thetis not to die;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But that grey bard did him immortal make</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With verses dipt in dews of Castaly.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<h3>ARMORY</h3>


<p class="right"><em>August</em> 18th, 1917</p>


<p>We are still full of excitement at our selection from
among the National Guard Regiments of New York to
represent our State in the selected 42nd or Rainbow Division
which is to go abroad amongst the very first for active
service. It is an undeniable compliment to the condition
of the Regiment and we are pleased at that as well as at the
prospects of carrying our battle-ringed standards to fly their
colors on the fields of France. Our Regimental organization
has been accepted intact—it is no composite Regiment
that has been selected; it is the 69th New York. Our ranks
however are to be swelled to the new total of 3,600 men by
the transfer of enlisted men from the five other city Regiments
of Infantry. We would have been glad to have done
our own recruiting as we could easily have managed; but
these are the orders. We shall give a royal Irish welcome
to our new companions in arms. They are volunteers like
ourselves and fellow townsmen, and after a little feeling out
of one another’s qualities we shall be a united Regiment.</p>

<p>Already we have received the contingent from our old
friends in the 7th—handed over to us with a large gesture
of comradeship which that old Regiment knows so well
how to make. The departing body of 320 men were escorted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
by the remaining officers and men, and passed
through their guard of honor to our Armory floor. Our
2,000 lined the walls and many perched themselves on the
iron beams overhead. They cheered and cheered and
cheered till the blare of the bands was unheard in the joyous
din—till hearts beat so full and fast that they seemed
too big for the ribs that confined them, till tears of emotion
came, and something mystical was born in every breast—the
soul of a Regiment. Heaven be good to the enemy
when these cheering lads go forward together into battle.</p>


<h3>CAMP MILLS</h3>


<p class="right"><em>September</em> 1st, 1917</p>


<p>We are tenting tonight on the Hempstead Plains, where
Colonel Duffy and the Old 69th encamped in 1898, when
getting ready for service in the Spanish War. It is a huge
regiment now—bigger, I think, than the whole Irish Brigade
ever was in the Civil War.</p>

<p>We have received our new men transferred from the
12th, 14th, 23rd and 71st N. G. N. Y. Our band played
them into Camp with the Regimental Air of “Garry Owen”
mingled with the good-fellow strains of “Hail! Hail! the
Gang’s All Here.”</p>

<p>All in all, the newcomers are a fine lot. A couple of our
sister organizations have flipped the cards from the bottom
of the pack in some instances and worked off on us some
of their least desirables. On the other hand, all the Regiments
have made up for that by allowing men anxious to
come to us to change places with those who prefer to stick
where they are. This gives us a large number of the men
we want—those that feel their feet on their native heath in
the 69th, and those that like its recruiting slogan, “If you
don’t want to be amongst the first to go to France, don’t
join the 69th.” For the rest, the Company Commanders
and Surgeons know “Thirty-five distinct damnations,” or
almost that many, by which an undesirable can be returned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
to civilian life to take his chances in the draft. Our recruiting
office has been reëstablished at the Armory. We
can get all the good men we want.</p>

<p>As he had put the matter in my hands Kilmer did not
come over with the men from the 7th, but I had the matter
of his transfer arranged after a short delay.</p>


<h3>CAMP MILLS</h3>


<p class="right"><em>September</em> 26th, 1917</p>


<p>I do not know whether to take it as a mark of general
interest in the Old Regiment or as the result of the spontaneous
big-heartedness of a kindly and enthusiastic Irish
artist—but John McCormack sang for us tonight. Sang in
the open air with no stinting of voice or program. Our
lads could have listened to him till morning; I never saw
such an eager mob. They kept calling for their favorite
McCormack songs and he, like the fine big Bouchal that he
is, laughed at their sallies and gave them their hearts’ desire,
until I closed the unique performance by reminding
them (and him) that we had a financial interest in his voice
because he was to sing for the benefit of our Trustees Fund
at no distant date. While I write, the camp is buzzing
around me with talk of the great tenor. A voice from the
darkness sums it up. “I always knew he was a great
singer. We got a lot of his records at home. But the records
never learned me that he’s such a hell of a fine fellow.”</p>


<h3>CAMP MILLS</h3>


<p class="right"><em>Sunday</em></p>


<p>I mess with the Headquarters Company, and James Collintine,
who has the job of looking after us, always welcomes
Sunday morning because it gives a chance for a
friendly chat between the two of us. James had been a deep-water
sailor for a good many years since he first left his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
home in the Old Country, but has taken up with the Infantry
because it gives more prospects for fighting service in
this war. This morning he said, “Father Duffy, did ye iver
hear of Father Hearrn of my parish in the County Longford?”
“No, Jim, I never did.” “Well, he was the grandest
man in all Ireland. There was eight hundhred min in
Maynooth College where they study to be priests and he
could lick ivery dam wan of thim. He was a fine big man,
six foot two in his stockin’ feet. He used to come down
the sthreet with a big stick in his hand, and if anybody
gave anny throuble he’d knock you down just as quick as
look at you. The whole parish loved him. Wanst there
was a fight in the village green between the peelers and
the people, and Father Hearrn was sent for to keep the
peace and he came down the road bowling over the peelers
as if they was nine pins. There niver was a nicer man
within the four seas of Ireland.”</p>

<p>A soldier of Company K came to my tent one afternoon
last week and stood at the entrance fumbling his hat in his
hand like an Irish tenant of the old days that had not the
rent to pay the landlord. “What’s the matter, Tom?” “I
took a dhrop too much, and Captain Hurley got very mad
about it and brought me up before Major Moynahan. I
wouldn’t mind if they’d fine me and be through with it, for
I know I deserve it. But the Major and the Captain say
that they’re not going to stand anything like this, and that
they won’t lave me go to the war. And sure, Father Duffy,
if I couldn’t go to the war it’d kill me.” The smile that
came to my lips at this very Irish way of putting it was
suppressed when I thought of the number of men born
in the country who were worried sick lest the Draft should
catch them and send them to the war. I assured Tom that
I would use my powers of persuasion with the Captain and
the Major to give him his heart’s desire, if he would take
the pledge. But we shall keep him worried by a suspended
sentence until we get him safely away from the temptations
of New York.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p>I have found an old friend in Camp in the person of Mike
Donaldson of Company I. Mike was an altar boy of mine
in Haverstraw not long after I was ordained. We both
left there, I to teach metaphysics and Mike for a career in
the prize-ring, in which he became much more widely and
favorably known to his fellow citizens than I can ever hope
to be. One of his titles to fame is that he was sparring
partner to Stanley Ketchell. He has brought me a set of
battered boxing gloves which he presented to me with a
very moving speech as relics of that departed hero. I do
not know exactly what he expects me to do with the relics
but I rather feel after his speech of presentation that it
would be considered appropriate if I suspend them reverently
from the rafter of my chapel like the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex voto</i> offerings
of ships that one sees in seaport shrines.</p>

<p>I have become a marrying Parson. Love and fighting
seem to go together—they are the two staples of romance.
I have had a large number of marriages to perform. In
most cases the parties enter my church tent from the rear
and are quietly married before the simple altar. We have
had a few weddings however on the grand scale. Michael
Mulhern of the Band had arranged for a quiet wedding with
a very sweet little girl named Peggy O’Brien. This afternoon
at four o’clock when I was ready to slip over with the
young couple and their witnesses to my canvas church I
saw the band forming. “What is this formation for, Michael.
You don’t have to be in it, do you?” “Ah, Father,”
said Michael, with a blush, “the boys heard somehow what
was going to happen and they’re going to serenade us.”
We had to parade over to church behind the band playing
a wedding march, with 10,000 soldiers and visitors following
curiously in the rear. So Michael and his bride were
united in matrimony before a vast throng that cheered
them, and showered them with rice that soldiers brought
over from the kitchens, many of the lads battling with the
groom for the privilege of kissing the bride.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>



<p class="right"><em>October</em> 15th, 1917</p>


<p>We will soon be off to the war and I have been looking
over the Regiment, studying its possibilities.</p>

<p>About the enlisted men I have not a single doubt. If
this collection of hand-picked volunteers cannot give a good
account of themselves in battle, America should keep out of
war. The men will fight no matter who leads them. But
fighting and winning are not always the same thing, and
the winning depends much on the officers—their military
knowledge, ability as instructors and powers of leadership.
The Non-coms are a fine lot. The First Sergeants as I run
over the list are a remarkable body of good old-time soldiers.
Starting with Company A, we have John O’Leary,
John O’Neill, William Hatton, Tom Sullivan, William Bailey,
Joseph Blake, John Burke, Jerome O’Neill, Patrick
McMeniman, Tim Sullivan, Eugene Gannon, John Kenny;
with Denis O’Shea, A. McBride, J. Comiskey, and W. W.
Lokker, for H. Q. M. G. Supply and Medical. All of these
men have been tried out in the eight months of Border
service and we are sure of them. Under Colonel Haskell
the hard driven Company Commanders had to break their
Sergeants in, or break them—life was too strenuous for favoritism.
In fact, except for recruits, it is surprisingly
Haskell’s regiment that is going to the front; Haskell’s,
that is, with the reservation that his work was done on the
basis of Colonel Conley’s selection and promotion in the
more difficult period of peace service. When we were selected
for immediate over-seas service the authorities were
free to make what changes they would, and they left the
regiment intact except for the transfer of one Major and
one Captain. The M. G. Company was vacant by resignation.
All other officers remained at their posts, though
we have been assigned a large number of newly created
Lieutenants to correspond with the new tables of organization
for a regiment of three thousand six hundred.</p>

</figure>

<p>We like our new Colonel, though he was a total stranger
to us before the day he came to command us. He is a West
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>Pointer, and went into railroading after some years in the
army as a Lieutenant; but he has loyally reverted to the
army whenever there was a real call to arms. In 1898 if
I had achieved my desire to go out as Chaplain of the 1st
D. C. I would have had him as one of my Majors. He
came into this conflict as organizer and commander of
trains, a work for which his experience fitted him. He is
a man of middle height with a strong body and an attractive
face, healthily ruddy, strongly featured, with a halo of
thick grey hair above. He is a man of ideas, of ideas
formed by contact with life and business. He is a tireless
worker, and demands the same unflinching service from
every man under him. He has confidence in his men, especially
the tried soldiers, and he has a strong liking for the
Regiment and its traditions. The Regiment will do good
work under the leadership of Colonel Charles Hine.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Colonel Reed I like better and better every
day I am with him. I did not take to him at first and I
think he was largely to blame. He kept himself too much
aloof. The fault, however, was partly ours. He came to
us at a time when we felt suspicious that it was the intention
to destroy our character as an Irish organization, and
we owed too much to the men who had created the Regiment
and made its reputation with their blood to submit
tamely to such a scheme as that. Colonel Reed was not
used to being where he was not wanted, and his attitude
was the result of this decent feeling. When the task of
forming a war strength regiment fell to him he took hold
and worked with single-minded vigor, and he then found
that everybody was anxious to work with him loyally. He
discovered, what I could have told him, that one thing the
Sixty-ninth admires is a good soldier. And Reed is a good
soldier, keen, active, and aggressive. He learned at once
to love the regiment and is as enthusiastic as myself in his
regard for it. We spend a great deal of our free time together,
for we have much in common.</p>

<p>The senior Major, Timothy J. Moynahan, is the ideal of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
the Irish soldier, as he comes down to us in history and in
fiction. He inherits from Patrick Sarsfield’s cavaliers, from
the regiments of Dillon and Burke at Fontenoy, from the
Connaught Rangers at Fuentes d’Onoro. A soldier born—trim,
erect, handsome, active in his movements, commanding
and crisp in his orders. And a soldier bred—he
lives for the military game, devotes his life to his work as
military instructor in colleges, and to the old 69th. He is
ready with a toast or a speech or a neatly phrased compliment,
and equally ready to take up the gage of battle, if
anyone should throw it down. A vivid interesting character
in our drab modern life. He has one fault—a flaring
Irish temper when military discipline is violated or high
ideals belittled. A fault, yes, but I feel there will be tense
moments of life for anybody with Tim Moynahan when the
time comes for a death grapple with the Germans. Phil
Sheridan would have delighted in him.</p>

<p>Major Stacom is my parishioner and I am his recruit.
He acquired his interest in soldiering as a boy at St. Francis
Xavier College under the stalwart old soldier, afterwards
the hero of Santiago—Captain Drum. He came
to the Regiment as a boy out of college, an enlisted man,
and the Irish lads, after guying the handsome youngster in
his college clothes, learned to love and admire him for his
knowledge and ability. When he became Captain of Company
B he recruited it by his personal efforts, and on the
Border he had one of the best companies in the Regiment.
Colonel Haskell picked him from the Company Commanders
as the first man to nominate for a Majority. He rules
by reason and kindliness, and evokes the best co-operation
of all under him—officers or men.</p>

<p>Major William J. Donovan, who commands the first Battalion
was transferred to us from the Brigade Staff, but
he is no stranger to us. On the Border when he was Captain
of Troop I of the 1st Cavalry he was the best known
man of his rank in the New York Division. It was almost
certain that Donovan would be appointed our Colonel after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
the efforts to get Colonel Haskell had failed, as he was our
next choice, and General O’Ryan knew that there were no
politics about it, but a sincere desire to find the best military
leader. General O’Ryan esteems Donovan as highly as we
do. When we were selected to put the green in the Rainbow
all the vacancies were to be filled by transfer, not by
promotion. Donovan was a Major on the Staff of our Brigade.
Everybody knew that he could get higher rank by
staying with the 27th Division but he preferred to join in
with us. He would rather fight with the 69th than with any
other Regiment, especially now that it is to be the first in
the fray, and he would rather be Major than Colonel, for
in battles as now conducted it is Majors who command in
the actual fighting.</p>

<p>Donovan is a man in the middle thirties, very attractive
in face and manner, an athlete who always keeps himself
in perfect condition. As a football player at Niagara and
Columbia, he gained the sobriquet of “Wild Bill.” But
that is tribute gained by his prowess rather than his demeanor.
He is cool, untiring, strenuous, a man that always
uses his head. He is preparing his men for the fatigues
of open warfare by all kinds of wearying stunts.
They too call him “Wild Bill” with malicious unction, after
he has led them over a cross country run for four miles.
But they admire him all the same, for he is the freshest man
in the crowd when the run is over. He is a lawyer by profession,
and a successful one, I am told. I like him for his
agreeable disposition, his fine character, his alert and eager
intelligence. But I certainly would not want to be in his
Battalion.</p>

<p>Major George Lawrence of the Sanitary Detachment is
one of the best acquisitions of our Border experience.
When Major Maguire had to leave us, we all reached out
for Lawrence, who was attached to the 12th, but was doing
duty at the hospital there. He is well educated, a product
of St. Francis Xavier and Pennsylvania, a competent physician
and surgeon, a famous athlete in football and basketball<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
in his day, and an athlete still; and one of the most
devoted and most reliable men that God has made for the
healing of wounds of mind or body. When I think of what
we shall have to go through it makes me feel good to see
George Lawrence around.</p>

<p>Captain Walter E. Powers of Headquarters Company is
an old soldier though still a young man. He entered the
Regular Army out of high school, out of short trousers, I
tell him. He was Regimental Sergeant Major of the 7th
Cavalry when Haskell was Adjutant of that famous Regiment.
And when Haskell became Colonel he pulled Powers
out of the Pershing Expedition and made him Adjutant of
the 69th; and he was the best Adjutant on the Border.
Latterly he has begun to pine for a Company and Colonel
Hine gave him the Headquarters Company, the duties of
which are so varied and so new that it will take a soldier-lawyer
like Powers to organize it. He has the keenest dryest
humor of any man I know. If he had not run away to
be a soldier he would have made a successful lawyer or
journalist.</p>

<p>Captain George McAdie of Company A is a Scotchman.
We tell him that is the worst thing we know about him,
which is our way of saying that we do not know anything
bad about him. Personally I am very fond of our Scottish
cousins, because I have known many real Scotchmen
and not merely jokes about them. The jokes never give
you a suspicion that Scotland idolizes Robert Burns, and
produces fighting men as fine as there are in the world.
George is my kind of Scot—like a volcano, rugged to outward
view, but glowing with fire beneath. A good soldier
and a true friend—you like him when you know him a
while, and you find something new to like in him the longer
you know him. If his health be as strong as his spirit he
will do great things in the 69th.</p>

<p>Captain Thomas Reilley of Company B is an imposing
being. He stands six feet three or so and fills the eye with
seeing any way you look at him. He is also a college athlete,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
a football player of renown, of Columbia and New
York Universities. A lawyer of real power and ability, he
has not given himself time yet to reach his full stride in his
profession. Since his college days he has been too much in
demand for other services for which his endowments and
instincts fit him—athlete, soldier, with a short course in
political life, characteristically as an independent. He
writes well and talks well—too well, sometimes, for the
Irish in him makes him indifferent to the effects of what
he has to say. It makes him indifferent to all other sorts of
danger too; so with his great physical and mental powers
and his capacity for organization he will render invaluable
service to the work of the Regiment.</p>

<p>Captain William Kennedy of Company C is also an athlete,
with the build of a runner, clean-cut, trim, alert. Brisk
is the word that describes him, for the trait is mental as
well as physical. He is a Company drill master in the
best sense of the word. I have never seen anybody who
could get more snap out of a body of men with less nagging,
whether it was a parade or a policing detail than Bill
Kennedy. I expect to see Company C the smartest Company
in the Regiment.</p>

<p>Captain James A. McKenna of Company D is a lawyer—Harvard
and Fordham produced him. He is a fellow of
great ability, ambitious, energetic and enduring. He will
go far in any line he may choose, and as a soldier he will
score a high mark. He has fine ideals and fine sentiments
which he chooses to conceal under a playfully aggressive or
business-like demeanor. But his enthusiasms, patriotic,
religious, personal, are the true fundaments of him, and
everybody feels it. He lets himself out most in his affection
for his men who reciprocate his devotion. Company D under
Jim McKenna will play a big part in our annals of war.</p>

<p>Alexander E. Anderson of Company E is a 69th man by
heredity. His uncle, Colonel Duffy, commanded the Regiment
in 1898. His cousin, Major John Duffy, was in the
Regiment when Anderson was old enough to join it—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
he joined it as a private just as soon as they would let
him. He is a soldier through and through. His family
and his business are near to him, but the 69th is first in
his thoughts. He has gone through all the stages from private
to captain without any family favoritism and today he
stands out as the keenest Captain in the Regiment. He
went to an Officer’s Training School two years ago and
graduated with a hundred percent. Sometimes they call
him the 100 percent soldier, a title which grates on him
exceedingly, for he hates such labels of praise, whether
meant or not. Colonel Hine has asked me for the names
of three Captains who might be recommended for Majors
in emergency. I told him I would name only one, and
after that one, half a dozen or more. “Oh,” he said, “you
mean Anderson. That is what the Battalion Commanders
all say.”</p>

<p>Captain Michael Kelly is an old soldier, though not an old
man. He can wear military medals on dress-suit occasions
which puzzle even the experts. A County Clare man by
birth, he was drawn by fighting instincts as a youth into
the British Army, since there was no Irish Army organized,
and fought through the Boer War and Burmese campaigns.
In New York he is second in command of the aqueduct police
and a Captain of the 69th, succeeding Captain P. J.
Maguire, who gave up his beloved Company F with satisfaction
only because it fell to his trusted Lieutenant. Captain
Kelly is a soldier first, last and all the time. His
spear knoweth no brother. He visits infractions of military
discipline with sternness and vigor. His Company stands
in awe of him, and boasts of him to others. They are
well looked after. If I have anything to distribute I have
to keep an eye on him and Anderson, the two tyrants
amongst Company Commanders. Give them their way
and everything would go to Companies E and F, with a
humorous growl between the two as to who gets the most
of the spoils.</p>

<p>The Irish-American A. C. gave us Captain James Archer,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
as it and kindred organizations have given us many of our
best soldiers. There are few young fellows around New
York who have not heard of Jimmy Archer, and many a one
has watched with delight his fleet limbs carrying his graceful
figure and shining head around the track to victory. He
has the cleanness and fineness of the amateur track athlete—very
distinctly a man and a gentleman. He has won his
way through every step upward in the Regiment and has
fairly won his race to the Captain’s bars.</p>

<p>Captain James G. Finn of Company H is a Spanish
War veteran, though he looks so young that he has to carry
around his service record and the family Bible to prove it.
Not that anybody would call Jim a liar. Not after taking
one look at him. He is a broad-shouldered, big-chested fellow,
one that the eye will pick out of a crowd, even in a
congested crowd, for he stands above the heads of ordinary
mortals. A football player, of course—Dartmouth College.
A big honest manly man and a devoted soldier. Jim Finn
thinks that Company H is the best bunch of fighting men
that ever shouldered a rifle, and Company H knows that
their big Captain is the finest man in the American Army.
There are two hundred and fifty of them, and the Captain
has thews like the son of Anak, so I don’t intend to start
anything by contradicting either of them. Anyway, I more
than half agree with them.</p>

<p>Captain Richard J. Ryan of Company I is a new comer
and, like a boy in a new town, he has his way to make.
If I be not “mistook in my jedgments” he will make it.
He hails from Watertown, New York, and from the 1st
New York Infantry, but that does not complete his military
history. He fought in the Boer War, I suspect from
the same reason that prompted Kelly—because that was the
only war there was, and a man must do the best with the
opportunities he has. He is all wrapped up in his Company.
He does not seem to care a hang what anybody
higher up is thinking about him. He has his job and he
wants to see it done right. That is a good sign. A soldier<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
by natural instinct and preference, a Captain devoted to
his men—that goes with the 69th. I am for him.</p>

<p>Captain John Patrick Hurley of Company K, is an argument
for the continued existence of the Irish as a people.
He has everything that everybody loves in the Irish, as
found even the reluctant tributes of their hereditary foes.
He has a lean, clean handsome face and figure, and a
spirit that responds to ideals patriotic, religious, racial,
human, as eagerly and naturally as a bird soaring into its
native air. He is perfectly willing to die for what he believes
in. He would find that much easier than to live in a
world of the cheap and commonplace. He always reminds
me of the Easter-week patriots of Dublin, Patrick Pearse
and Plunkett and MacDonagh. Like myself, and I may
say all of us, he is in this war as a volunteer because he
feels that it is a war against the tyranny of the strong,
and a fight for the oppressed peoples of the earth. He is
an able, practical man withal; an engineer, graduate of Cornell.
He rules his company as their military commander,
and the tribute of affection and loyalty they pay him is not
lessened by the knowledge they have that breaches of discipline
will meet with no mercy.</p>

<p>Captain Merle-Smith of Company L came to us on the
Border from Squadron A, and the intervening year of intimacy
has not changed the judgment I uttered the first
time I saw him: “If I had to pick out one man to spend a
year with me on a voyage to Central Africa, there is the
man I would select.” A big fellow—he and Reilly and Finn
are our prize specimens—and big, like them, all the way
through; and with the astonishing simplicity—in the old
theological sense of the word as contrasted with duplicity—that
one so often finds in big men. A college athlete
(Princeton) and a lawyer, the contests of the campus and
the bar have only whetted his appetite for more intense
battles. From the time he joined us he has felt that the
best opening for real soldier work is in this regiment. He
is a 69th man by conviction, and he is as fond of his valiant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
Kerrymen in Company L as they are of him. I found no
one in the recruiting period more zealous in increasing the
numbers of the regiment and maintaining at the same time
its characteristic flavor than Captain Van Santvoordt Merle-Smith.</p>

<p>Captain William Doyle commanded Company M when
we were called out, but since Captain Powers took the
Headquarters Company he has been made Adjutant. It was
a good choice. Captain Doyle is a college man (St. Francis
Xavier) and an engineer by profession, and has been a
National Guardsman for more years than one would guess.
His training fits him for his new job. His mind is quick
on the trigger, though the speed and accuracy with which
it shoots a retort is rendered deceptive by his slightly
humorous drawl in delivery. He is not one of the big fellows,
but the big fellows think twice before taking him on.</p>

<p>Martin Meaney, Captain of Company M, was a Sergeant
of Company G when we were in Texas. I wanted Colonel
Haskell to make him a Second Lieutenant, but Martin
hadn’t left the County Clare soon enough to satisfy the technicality
of having his final citizen papers. He could fight
for the United States, but he could not be an officer. He
came of age as a citizen during the summer and went to
Plattsburg, and the people in charge there made him not a
Second Lieutenant but a Captain. Colonel Haskell, who is
Adjutant at Camp Upton, found the chance to send him
back to us as a Captain, and we were very glad to get him.
For we know Martin Meaney; and everyone who knows
Martin Meaney likes him and trusts him. He is a fine,
manly upstanding young Irishman devoted to high ideals,
practical and efficient withal. Granted the justice of my
cause there is no man in the world I would so much rely on
to stick to me to the end as Martin Meaney. It makes us
all feel better to have him along with us in our adventure
of war.</p>

<p>The vacancy in the Machine Gun Company was filled by
the appointment of Captain Kenneth Seibert, an old guardsman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
of the Iowa National Guard. He has the position of
Johnny-come-lately with us yet, but he knows the game
and he will be a veteran of ours by the time we get to our
first battle. His whole organization is practically new, but
he is very keen about it, and is an excellent manager, so
we feel that he will soon have it in shape.</p>

<p>Captain John Mangan of the Supply Company is the salt
of the earth. I like Jack Mangan so much that I always
talk that way about him, and incidentally I waste his time
and mine by holding him for a chat whenever we meet. He
came to us before we went to the Border. His friends
were in another regiment, but all that was nice and Irish
about him made him want to be with the 69th. He is a
Columbia man and a contractor. Colonel Haskell got
his eye on him, when, as a Second Lieutenant, he was put
in charge of a detail of offenders who had to do some
special work. Under Mangan their work was not mere pottering
around. They did things. While we were on the
big hike Mangan was left behind with a detail of cripples
to build mess shacks. They were built, created is a better
word, but we were doomed never to use them, as we got
orders during the hike to proceed to another station. I said
to Haskell: “Don’t forget to compliment Lieutenant Mangan
on his work, for he has done wonders, and it looks now
to have been all in vain.” Haskell answered with assumed
grimness: “Lieutenant Mangan will not be Lieutenant
Mangan long.” He was Captain Mangan, R. S. O. (Regimental
Supply Officer) as soon as the formalities could be
arranged; and in a short time he was the best supply officer
on the Border, as his training as a contractor gave him experience
in handling men and materials.</p>

<p>Everybody likes Mangan—half-rebellious prisoners and
soldering details and grasping civilians and grouchy division
quartermasters. For “he has a way wid him.” At
bottom it is humor and justness, with appreciation of the
other fellow’s difficulties and states of mind. With his
fairness and balance, he carries such an atmosphere of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
geniality and joy of life that everybody begins to feel a new
interest in the game and a new willingness to play a decent
part in it.</p>

<p>So far as I can see it now, our Captains average higher
than our Lieutenants, though time will have to show if I am
right. But at present I can point my finger to half a dozen
Captains at least who could easily fill the job of Major,
without being so certain of finding an equal number of
Lieutenants who could make as good Captains as the men
they replace. Probably all that this proves is that the Captains
have the advantage of experience in their positions,
and that their juniors, when equal opportunity is given
them, will develop to be just as good. Amongst the Lieutenants
the first to my mind is John Prout, a fine young
Tipperary man of the stamp of Hurley and Meaney. Others
in line are Samuel A. Smith, John Poore and William
McKenna, the four Burns brothers (all good, but Jim in my
judgment the best), also William Burns, Richard Allen,
Clifford, Kelley, Kinney, Joseph McNamara, Crimmins,
Carroll, Andrew Lawrence, John Green, Thomas C. Martin,
with Rowley, Grose, Baker, Joseph O’Donohue, James
Mangan, O’Brien, Philbin, Cavanaugh, Reune Martin, who
came to us while in the Armory. Of the newcomers sent
to us here at Camp Mills four of the old regular army men
stand out: Lieutenants Michael J. Walsh, Henry A. Bootz,
Patrick Dowling and Francis McNamara. Our Medical
Department consists of Major Lawrence with Doctors
Houghton, Lyttle, Martin, Kilcourse, Levine, Patton, Bamford,
Austin Lawrence and Landrigan.</p>



<p class="right"><em>October</em> 25th, 1917</p>


<p>We are the best cared for Regiment that ever went to
war. Mr. Daniel M. Brady, who was chairman of the Committee
for employment, appointed by Justice Victor J. Dowling
of the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick, when we came
back from the Border, has reorganized and increased that
body and our Board of Trustees now consists of Morgan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
J. O’Brien, chairman, Daniel M. Brady, John J. Whalen,
Joseph P. Grace, Victor J. Dowling, John D. Ryan, George
McDonald, Nicholas F. Brady, John E. O’Keefe, Louis D.
Conley, and Bryan Kennedy. They have raised ample
funds from private subscriptions and from the generous
benefits offered through the kindly generosity of the New
York Baseball Club and of Mr. John McCormack. They
have given $10,000.00 in cash to the Company and Regimental
Funds, and $1,600 for the Chaplain’s Fund “for
religion and divilment.” All sorts of sporting goods, including
two complete sets of uniforms of Giants and Cubs,
equip us fully for the sort of strenuous life which we most
enjoy.</p>

<p>The Women’s Auxiliary is also formed, Mrs. Hennings
being the President, for looking after the families of soldiers
while they are away, and sending gifts abroad.</p>

<p>Some of our wealthy friends in the Board of Trustees
have also held dinners to which have been invited the principal
officers of Regiment, Brigade, and Division. It has
helped us to get acquainted with our chief superiors. I
was particularly glad to have the opportunity of getting a
more intimate knowledge of General Mann and his Chief of
Staff, Colonel Douglas McArthur—a brilliant youthful-looking
soldier for whom I had already formed a high
esteem and admiration from casual meeting. He has been
very helpful in furthering my plans to have a large body of
priests from Brooklyn and New York give the men of
the whole Division an opportunity of receiving the sacraments
before going abroad.</p>


<h3>MONTREAL</h3>


<p class="right"><em>October</em> 28th, 1917</p>


<p>Orders at last. They came in for the 1st Battalion October
25th. They slipped out quietly by night. I went with
them to Montreal, travelling with Companies B and D.
The men were in gleeful spirits, glad to have the wait over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
and to be off on the Long Trail. Edward Connelly and I
sat up chatting most of the night. One remark of his
struck me. His father was Captain of Company B in the
69th during the Civil War. “Some people say to me, ‘With
your two boys I don’t see how you can afford to go to
war.’ With my two boys I can’t see how I can afford not
to go to war.”</p>

<p>The two soldiers who appealed to me most aboard the
train were Supply Sergeant Billy McLaughlin and Lieutenant
Bootz. They stayed up all night to look after our needs,
and they showed a combination of efficiency and cheerfulness—a
very model of soldierly spirit.</p>

<p>I saw them all onto the <em>Tunisia</em> on their way to Liverpool.
God speed them.</p>

IN TRAINING ABROAD</h2>
</div>

<h3>BREST</h3>

<p class="right"><em>November</em> 13th, 1917</p>

<p>We moved out of Camp Mills on the night of October
29th and took trains at the nearby station—off at last for
foreign service. Parts of Companies L and M were left
to guard the camp. We found at Hoboken that we were
to sail on a fine ship—the converted German liner <em>Amerika</em>
which had been re-christened with the change of the penultimate
letter. Our trip was uneventful. The seas were
calm, and sailing on the <em>America</em> was like taking a trip
on the end of a dock—you had to look over the side to
realize that she was in motion. No submarines, though we
were on constant watch for them. “What are you doing
here?” asked one of the ship’s officers of big Jim Hillery,
who stood watch. “Looking for something Oi don’t want
to foind,” answered Jim with a grin.</p>

<p>We did not know where our journey was to end but
finally on November 12th we made port in the beautiful
harbor of Brest, where we have been idling all week because
we have been the first convoy to put in here, and
no preparations have been made to land us and our equipment,
and afford transportation to our destination.</p>



<p class="right"><em>November</em> 15th, 1917</p>


<p>This morning I told Colonel Hine that I wanted a day
in town to get some necessaries for my church work, and
permission was readily granted. I inquired the way to
the nearest church, timing my visit to get in around the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
dinner hour, so as to get an invitation for a meal. As I
rang the bell of the rectory, the door opened and a poor
woman with two children came out carrying a basket into
which the housekeeper had put food. I said to myself:
Where charity exists, hospitality ought to flourish. I waited
in the customary bare ecclesiastical parlor for the Curé,
and at last he came, a stout middle-aged man, walking with
a limp. I presented myself, very tall and quite imposing
in my long army overcoat, and told him I came in search
of altar breads. He immediately proposed to take me to a
convent some distance away where my wishes might be satisfied.
As I followed him along the cobbled streets I said
to myself, “I had thought these Bretons were a kind of
Irish, but they lack the noblest of the traditions of the Celtic
race, or this old gentleman would have asked me to dinner.”
It was only later that I found that my tremendous
presence had embarrassed him and he had therefore decided
to bring me to somebody whom nothing would embarrass.
One need not say that this was a woman—the Mother
Superior of an institution which was school, orphanage and
<em>pension</em> in one.</p>

<p>She was of a type not unusual in heads of religious communities—cultivated,
balanced, perfectly serene. After supplying
my needs she asked gently, “Monsieur has dined?”
“No, Monsieur has not dined.” “Perhaps Monsieur would
accept the humble hospitality of the convent.” “Monsieur
is a soldier, and soldiers have but one obligation—never to
refuse a meal when they can get it.” She smiled and
brought me to the dining room, where I met the old chaplain
and two equally elderly professors from some college,
who pumped me about America and myself and Wilson
and myself and Roosevelt and myself until the meal
was over. Then I sallied forth with my stout Curé who
evidently had absorbed, as he sat silent through the meal,
all the information I had been giving out, particularly about
myself. For he brought me into forty stores and stopped
on the street at least a hundred people (and he knew everybody<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
in town) to introduce proudly his prize specimen
of an American priest in uniform. The introduction invariably
took this form:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>“Monsieur is an American.” “He is an officer.” “Monsieur,
though one would not know it, is a priest. He has a
large parish in the City of New York. He has been a Professor
in the Seminary—of Philosophy, mind you. Monsieur
has a parish with three vicaires. He receives from the noble
government of the United States a stipend of ten thousand
francs a year. That is what this great country gives their
Chaplains. He is a Chaplain. He has crosses on his collar.
Also on his shoulders. If I were taller I could see them. I
saw them when he was sitting down.”</p>
</div>

<p>And at the end, and always with a little break in his voice
as he fumbled with the button of my tunic, “M. L’Aumonier
wears the tricolor of our country with the badge of the
Sacred Heart, which was pinned there by the great Cardinal
of New York.” And this was the man that I thought
at first to be cold and unfriendly.</p>

<p>I had to break away finally to get back to my ship as
evening was beginning to gather. I started for the dock,
interested all the way to observe the Celtic types of the
passers-by and giving them names drawn from my Irish
acquaintance, as Tim Murphy or Mrs. O’Shaughnessy.
Feeling that I was not making for the dock from which I
left, I turned to a knot of boys, introducing myself as a
priest and telling them that I wanted to get back to the
American transports. They jumped to help me as eagerly
as my own altar boys at home would do. One alert black-eyed
lad of fourteen took command of the party, the rest
of them trailing along and endeavoring to give advice and
support. But from the beginning this one youngster was
in undoubted command of the situation. I tried once or
twice to ask where he was bringing me, but received only a
brief “Suivez-moi, Monsieur.” Our journey ended in an
alley where the calls of my guide brought out two fishermen
who needed only red night-caps and knives in their teeth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
to bring up associations of Stevenson’s pirate-mutineers.
But they were ready to ferry me over to my ship for a
compensation, a compensation which became quite moderate
when my Mentor explained their obligation as Catholics
and as Frenchmen to a priest and an ally.</p>

<p>I was about to embark in their fishing smack when a
French marine came along the dock and said that under no
circumstances could a boat cross the harbor after sunset.
My fishermen argued; I argued; even my irresistible young
guide stated the case; but to no avail. Finally I said to
the youngster, “Why waste my time with this creature of a
marine. Lead me to the person the most important in
Brest, the Mayor, the Governor, the Master of the Port, the
Commander of the Fleet. From such a one I shall receive
permission.” The youth gave me a quick look and I think
he would have winked if my face were not so sternly set
with the importance I had assumed. He led me off to
the office of the Harbormaster. It was closed. I could
find no person except the janitor who was sweeping the
front steps. I was so put out at the prospect of not getting
back from my leave on time that I had to talk to some
person, so I told the janitor my worries. He insinuated
that something might be arranged. I had traveled in
Europe before and had learned how things get themselves
arranged. So I produced from my pocket a nice shiny
two-franc piece; and in a moment I discovered that I had
purchased for thirty-five cents in real money the freedom
of the Port of Brest. My janitor descended upon the
faithful marine with brandished broom and bellowed objurgations
that such a creature should block the way of this
eminent American Officer who wished to return to his ship.</p>

<p>I stood in the prow of the smack as we made our way
across the dark and rainy harbor and I felt for the first
time the touch of romance as one gets it in books. I
thought back over the day, and I had the feeling that my
adventures had begun, and had begun with a blessing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span></p>


<h3>NAIVES EN BLOIS</h3>


<p class="right"><em>Nov.</em> 27th, 1917</p>


<p>Naives in Blooey we call it, with a strong hoot on the
last word. If Thomas Cook and Son ever managed a personally
conducted party as we have been handled and then
landed it in a place like this, that long established firm
would have to close up business forthwith. Guy Empey
and all the rest of them had prepared us for the “Hommes
40; Chevaux 8” box-cars, but description never made anybody
realize discomforts. Anyway, we went through it and
we would have been rather disappointed if they had brought
us on our three-day trip across France in American plush-seat
coaches (by the way we growled about them when we
went to the Border). A year from now if we are alive we
shall be listening with an unconcealed grin of superiority
to some poor fish of a recruit who gabbles over the hardships
he has undergone in the side-door Pullmans.</p>

<p>We are forgetting our recent experiences already in the
meanness of these God-forsaken villages. We are in six
of them—each the worst in the opinion of the Companies
there. Naives will do for a description of Vacon, Broussey,
Villeroi, Bovée or Sauvoy. A group of 40 houses along
the slopes of a crinkled plain. The farmers all live together
in villages, as is the custom in France. And many
features of the custom are excellent. They have a church,
school, community wash houses with water supply, good
roads with a common radiating point and the pleasures
of society, such as it is.</p>

<p>The main drawback is that the house on the village
street is still a farm house. The dung heap occupies a place
of pride outside the front door; and the loftier it stands and
the louder it raises its penetrating voice, the more it proclaims
the worth and greatness of its possessor. The house
is half residence and half stable with a big farm loft over-topping
both. The soldiers occupy the loft. I censored a
letter yesterday in which one of our lads said: “There are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
three classes of inhabitants in the houses—first, residents;
second, cattle; third, soldiers.” Over my head are some
boys from Company B who got in ahead of us with the
First Battalion, coming by way of England and then via
Havre, after a long and tedious trip. They are Arthur
Viens, Tom Blackburn and Jim Lannon of my own parish
with Gilbert, Gilgar, Weick, and Healey. Their life is
typical of the rest. Up in the morning early and over to
Sergeant Gilhooley’s wayside inn for breakfast. Then cut
green wood for fire, or drill along the muddy roads or dig
in the muddier hillsides for a target range—this all day
with a halt for noon meal. Supper at 4:00 o’clock; and
already the sun has dropped out of the gloomy heavens, if
indeed it has ever shown itself at all. Then—then nothing.
They cannot light lanterns—we have landed right
bang up behind the front lines the first jump; we can hear
the heavy guns booming north along the St. Mihiel lines;
and the aeroplanes might take a notion to bomb the town
some night if lights stood out. No fire—dangerous to light
even a cigarette in a hay loft. There are a couple of wine
shops in town but they are too small to accommodate the
men. If they had a large lighted place where they could
have the good cheer of wine and chat evenings it would be
a blessing. They are not fond enough of “Pinard” to do
themselves harm with it and I think the pious inn keepers
see that it is well baptized before selling it. Good old
Senator Parker of the Y. M. C. A. has been right on the
job with tents for the men—of course without any curse
of “rum” in them—but the cold weather makes it difficult
to render them habitable.</p>

<p>So most of the men spread their blankets in the straw
and go to bed at six o’clock—a good habit in the minds of
old-fashioned folks. The squad overhead have another
good old-fashioned habit. From the stable below I can hear
them say their beads in common before settling down to
sleep. “Father” Pat Heaney of Company D got them into
the way of it on the boat. Good lads!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span></p>

<p>In comparison with them my fittings are palatial. I
have a large square low-ceilinged room with stone floor,
and French windows with big wooden shutters to enclose
the light. The walls are concealed by the big presses or
<em>Armoires</em> so dear to the housewives of Lorraine. The one
old lady who occupies this house has lived here for all of her
70 years (a German officer occupied the high canopied bed
in 1870) and she has never let any single possession she
ever had get away from her. They are all in the <em>Armoires</em>,
old hats, bits of silk, newspapers—everything. She is very
pious and very pleased to have M. l’Aumonier, but she
wouldn’t give me a bit of shelf room or a quarter inch of
candle or a handful of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petit bois</i> to start a fire in the
wretched fireplace, without cash down.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">“Monsieur is a Curé.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Yes, Madame.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>My landlady has been quizzing me about the Regiment,
my parish and myself. She doesn’t understand this volunteer
business. If we didn’t have to come, why are we
here? is her matter of fact attitude. She was evidently
not satisfied with what she could learn from me herself,
so one day she called to her aid a crony of hers, a woman
of 50 with a fighting face and straggly hair whom I had
dubbed “the sthreeler,” because no English word described
her so adequately. I had already heard the Sthreeler’s
opinion of the women in Paris—all of them. It would have
done the hussies good to hear what she thought of them.
Now she turned her interrogatory sword point at me; no
parrying about her methods—just slash and slash again.</p>

<p>“Monsieur has three vicaires.” “Yes, Madame.”</p>

<p>“Then why has M. l’Aumonier come over here? Why not
send one of the Vicaires and stay at home in his parish?”</p>

<p>“But none of the vicaires was aumonier of the Regiment;
but myself, M. le Curé.</p>

<p>“Oh, perhaps the Germans destroyed your parish as they
did that of our present curé.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>“No, the Germans have not got to New York yet so my
parish is still safe.”</p>

<p>“Ah, then, I have it. No doubt the Government pays you
more as aumonier than the church does as curé.”</p>
</div>

<p>This was said with such an evident desire to justify her
good opinion of me as a rational being in spite of apparent
foolishness, that I said: “That is precisely the reason”;
and we turned with zest to the unfailing topic of the
Parisiennes with their jewels and paint and high heels.
Not having her courage, I did not venture to ask the
sthreeler if she did not really envy them.</p>

<p>They are going in strong for education in the A. E. F.
and we have lost temporarily the services of many of our
best officers. Lieutenant Colonel Reed has gone off to
school and also the three Majors and half the Captains.
I hope they are getting something out of their schooling
for nobody here is learning anything except how to lead the
life of a tramp. The men have no place to drill or to shoot
or to manœuvre. I hear we are moving soon to fresh fields
further south—Heaven grant it, for we waste time here.</p>

<p>I think it was Horace who said something to the effect
that far-faring men change the skies above them but not
the hearts within them. That occurs to me when I see our
lads along the streets of this ancient Roman town. It is
old, old, old. You have to go down steps to get to the floor
of the 700-year-old Gothic nave of the church because the
detritus of years has gradually raised the level of the
square; and the tower of the church, a huge square donjon
with walls seven feet thick slitted for defensive bowmen,
is twice as old as the nave. And it has the ruins of an
amphitheatre and a well preserved mosaic pavement that
date back to the third century, when the Caesars had a big
camp here to keep the Gauls in order. I shan’t say that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
the men are not interested in these antiquities. They are
an intelligent lot, and unsated by sight-seeing, and they
give more attention to what they see than most tourists
would. When I worked the history of the place into my
Sunday sermon I could see that everybody was wide awake
to what I had to say.</p>

<p>But in their hearts they are still in good little old New
York. The quips and slang of New York play houses are
heard on the streets where Caesar’s legionaries chaffed each
other in Low Latin. Under the fifteen centuries old tower
Phil Brady maintains the worth of Flushing because Major
Lawrence hails from there. Paul Haerting and Dryer exchange
repartee outside the shrine of St. Libaire, Virgin and
Martyr, after their soldiers orisons at his tomb. Charles
Dietrich and Jim Gormley interrupt my broodings over the
past in the ruins of the amphitheater to ask me news about
our parish in the Bronx.</p>

<p>The 2nd and 3rd Battalions are not in such an antique
setting, but in two villages along the bare hillsides to the
south of us. It is a good walk to get to them; but I have
my reward. When I get to the 2nd Battalion, if the
men are busy, I drop in on Phil Gargan for a cup of coffee.
I am always reminded of my visits to Ireland by
the hospitality I encounter—so warm and generous and
bustling and overwhelming. I get my coffee, too much of
it, and too sweet, and hot beyond human endurance, and
food enough offered with it to feed a platoon. And I am
warm with a glow that no steaming drink could ever produce
of itself. It is the same wherever I go. For instance
if my steps lead me to the 3rd Battalion Pat Boland spices
his coffee with native wit; or if my taste inclines me to tea
I look up Pat Rogan who could dig up a cup of tea in the
middle of a polar expedition.</p>

<p>While I am on the question of eating—always an interesting
topic to a soldier—let me say a word for French
inns. I came to Grand with Regimental Sergeant Major
Steinert, ahead of the Regiment in charge of a billetting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
detail, and thus made the acquaintance of the establishment
of Madame Gerard at the Sign of the Golden Boar. I
have seen a M. Gerard but, as in all well regulated families,
he is a person with no claim to figure in a story. I am
in love for the first time, and with Madame Gerard. Capable
and human and merry, used to men and their queer
irrational unfeminine ways, and quite able to handle them,
hundreds at a time. A joke, a reprimand, and ever and
always the final argument of a good meal—easy as easy.
She reigns in her big kitchen, with its fireplace where the
wood is carefully managed but still gives heat enough to put
life and savor into the hanging pots and the sizzling turnspits.
Odors of Araby the blest! And she serves her
meals with the air of a beneficent old Grande Dame of
the age when hospitality was a test of greatness. Private
or General—it makes no difference to her. The same food
and the same price and the same frank motherly humor—and
they all respond with feelings that are common to all.
I sit before the kitchen fire while she is at work, and talk
about the war and religion and our poor soldiers so far
from their mothers, and the cost of food and the fun you
can get out of life, and when I get back to my cold room
I go to bed thinking of how much I have learned, and
that I can see at last how France has been able to stand
this war for three and a half years.</p>

<p>The Colonel’s mess is at the Curé’s house. It too is a
pleasant place to be, for the Colonel lays aside his official
air of severity when he comes to the table, and is his
genial, lovable self. The Curé dines with us—a stalwart
mountaineer who keeps a young boar in his back yard as a
family pet. One would have thought him afraid of nothing.
But courage comes by habit; and I found that the
Curé had his weak side. His years had not accustomed him
to the freaks of a drunken man—a testimonial to his parishioners.
We had a cook, an old Irishman, who could give
a new flavor to nectar on Olympus; that is, if he didn’t
drink too much of it first. But he would, trust Paddy for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
that, even if threatened with Vulcan’s fate of being pitched
out headfirst for his offense.</p>

<p>One day Tom Heaney and Billy Hearn came running for
me. Paddy on the rampage! The aged <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bonne</i> in hysterics.
The Curé at his wits’ end. Come! I went. I
found Paddy red-eyed and excited, and things in a mess. I
curtly ordered him into a chair, and sent for Doc. Houghton,
our mess officer, to do justice. Meanwhile I studied a map
on the wall, with my back turned to the offender, and
the following one-sided dialogue ensued—like a telephone
scene at a play.</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>“It’s that’s making me mad.” A pause,</p>

<p>“I don’t like you anyway.” A pause.</p>

<p>“You’re no good of a priest. If I was dying I wouldn’t”—(reconsidering)—“I
hope to God when I’m dying I won’t
have to put up with the likes of you.” A long pause.</p>

<p>“I’ve long had me opinion of you. I’ll tell it to you if you
like.”</p>

<p>A pause—with me saying to myself “Now you’ll get the
truth.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell it to you. I’ve been wanting to do it time and
times.... You smoke cigarettes with the Officers, that’s
what you do.” A sigh of relief, and the thought “I could have
said more than that myself.”</p>
</div>

<p>Then in bursts Colonel Hine and Paddy was hustled away
for punishment. But I know what will happen. We shall
eat army food <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">au naturel</i> for a week or so; and some noon
the meal will be so good that we shall all eat more than is
good for men with work still to do, and nobody shall ask
a question about it, for everybody will know that Paddy,
God bless him! is back on the job once more. Of course
I have a special liking for him because when he was in a
mood to denounce me he let me off so light.</p>


<h3>GRAND</h3>

<p class="right"><em>December</em> 25th, 1917</p>

<p>If there is one day in all the year that wanderers from
home cannot afford to forget it is Christmas. The Company<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
Commanders have had their Mess Sergeants scouring
the countryside for eatables.</p>

<p>It was my business to give them a religious celebration
that they would remember for many a year and that they
would write about enthusiastically to the folks at home,
who would be worrying about the lonesome existence of
their boys in France. The French military authorities and
the Bishop of the diocese had united in prohibiting Midnight
Masses on account of the lights. But General Lenihan,
the Mayor, and the Curé decided that we were too
far from the front to worry about that, and it was arranged
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tout de suite</i>. I knew that confessions and communions
would be literally by the thousands, so with the aid of Joyce
Kilmer and Frank Driscoll, ex-Jesuit-novice, I got up a
scheme for confessions of simple sins in English and
French, and set my French confrères to work; the Curé,
a priest-sergeant in charge of a wood cutting detail, a
<em>brancardier</em>, and another priest who was an officer of the
artillery—all on the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">qui vive</i> about the task. Christmas Eve
found us all busy until midnight. I asked one of the men
how he liked the idea of going to confession to a priest
who cannot speak English. “Fine, Father,” he said with a
grin, “All he could do was give me a penance, but you’d have
given me hell.” Luckily the church was vastly larger than
the present needs of the town, for everybody, soldiers and
civilians, came. General Lenihan and Colonel Hine and
the Brigade and the Regimental Staffs occupied seats in the
sanctuary which was also crowded with soldiers. The local
choir sang the Mass and I preached. Our lads sang the
old hymns, “The Snow Lay on the Ground,” “The Little
Town of Bethlehem,” and all, French and Americans, joined
in the ancient and hallowed strains of the <em>Adeste Fideles</em>
until the vaults resounded with <em>Venite Adoremus Dominum</em>.
It took four priests a long time to give Communion to the
throng of pious soldiers and I went to bed at 2:00 A. M.
happy with the thought that, exiles though we are, we celebrated
the old feast in high and holy fashion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p>

<p>Christmas afternoon we had general services in the big
market shed. The band played the old Christmas airs and
everybody joined in, until the square was ringing with our
pious songs.</p>

<p>Everybody had a big Christmas dinner. The Quartermaster
had sent the substantial basis for it and for extra
trimmings the Captains bought up everything the country
afforded. They had ample funds to do it, thanks to our
Board of Trustees, who had supplied us lavishly with funds.
The boxes sent through the Women’s Auxiliary have not
yet reached us. It is just as well, for we depart tomorrow
on a four-day hike over snowy roads and the less we have
to carry the better.</p>


<h3>LONGEAU</h3>

<p class="right"><em>January</em> 1st, 1918</p>

<p>I cannot tell just what hard fates this New Year may
have in store for us, but I am sure that no matter how trying
they may be they will not make us forget the closing
days of 1917. We left our villages in the Vosges the morning
after Christmas Day. From the outset it was evident
that we were going to be up against a hard task. It
snowed on Christmas, and the roads we were to take were
mean country roads over the foothills of the Vosges Mountains.
New mules were sent to us on Christmas Eve.
They were not shod for winter weather, and many of them
were absolutely unbroken to harness, the harness provided
moreover being French and ill-fitting. To get it on the
mules big Jim Hillery had to throw them first on the stable
floor.</p>

<p>It was everybody’s hike, and everybody’s purgatory; but
to my mind it was in a special way the epic of the supply
company and the detachments left to help them. Nobody
ever makes any comment when supplies are on hand on
time. In modern city life we get into the way of taking
this for granted, as if food were heaven-sent like manna,
and we give little thought to the planning and labor it has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
taken to provide us. On a hike the Infantry will get through—there
is never any doubt of that. They may be foot-sore,
hungry, broken-backed, frozen, half dead, but they
will get through. The problem is to get the mules through;
and it is an impossible one very often without human intelligence
and human labor. On this hike the marching men
carried no reserve rations, an inexcusable oversight. No
village could feed them even if there was money to pay
for the food; and the men could not eat till the Company
wagons arrived with the rations and field ranges.</p>

<p>The situation for Captain Mangan’s braves looked desperate
from the start. A mile out of town the wagons were
all across the road, as the lead teams were not trained to
answer the reins. The battle was on. Captain Mangan
with Lieutenant Kinney, a Past Grand Master when it comes
to wagon trains, organized their forces. They had experienced
helpers—Sergeant Ferdinando, a former circus man,
Sergeant Bob Goss and Regimental Supply Sergeant Joe
Flannery, who will be looking for new wars to go to when
he is four score and ten. It would be impossible to relate
in detail the struggles of the next four days; but that
train got through from day to day only by the fighting
spirit of soldiers who seldom have to fire a rifle. Again
and again they came to hills where every wagon was stalled.
The best teams had to be unhitched and attached to each
wagon separately until the hill was won. Over and over
the toil-worn men would have to cover the same ground till
the work was done, and in tough places they had to spend
their failing strength tugging on a rope or pushing a
wheel. Wagoners sat on their boxes with hands and feet
freezing and never uttered a complaint. The wagons were
full of food but no man asked for a mite of it—they
were willing to wait till the companies ahead would get their
share.</p>

<p>The old time men who had learned their business on
the Border were naturally the best. Harry Horgan, ex-cowboy,
could get anything out of mules that mules could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
do. Jim Regan, old 1898 man, had his four new mules
christened and pulling in answer to their names before
a greenhorn could gather up the reins. Larkin and young
Heffernan and Barney Lowe and Tim Coffee were always
first out and first in, but always found time to come back
and take the lines for some novice to get his wagon
through a hard place. Al Richford, Ed Menrose, Gene
Mortenson, Willie Fagan, Arthur Nulty, Wagoner Joe Seagriff
and good old Pat Prendergast did heroic work.
“Father” James McMahon made me prouder of my own
title. Slender Jimmy Benson got every ounce of power out
of his team without ever forgetting he belonged to the Holy
Name Society. Sergeant Lacey, Maynooth man and company
clerk, proved himself a good man in every Irish sense
of the word. Hillery and Tumulty, horseshoers; Charles
Henning of the commissary, and Joe Healy, cook, made
themselves mule-skinners once more, and worked with
energies that never flagged.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Henry Bootz came along at the rear of the
Infantry column to pick up stragglers. The tiredest and
most dispirited got new strength from his strong heart. “I
think I’m going to die,” said one broken lad of eighteen.
“You can’t die without my permission,” laughed the big
Lieutenant. “And I don’t intend to give it. I’ll take your
pack, but you’ll have to hike.” And hike he did for seven
miles farther that day, and all the way for two days more.
The first day Bootz threatened to tie stragglers to the
wagons. The remaining days he took all that could move
without an ambulance and tied the wagons to them. And
they had to pull.</p>

<p>Captain Mangan, the most resourceful of commanders,
was working in his own way to relieve the strain. One
day he took possession of a passing car and got to the
H. Q. of a French Division where the kindly disposed
French Officers were easily persuaded to send camions to
carry provisions ahead, to be stored for the troops at the
terminus of the day’s march. Horses were rented from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
the farmers, or, if they were stiff about it, abruptly commandeered.
That wagon train had to get through.</p>

<p>It got through; but sometimes it was midnight or after
before it got through; and meanwhile the line companies
had their own sufferings and sacrifices. They hiked with
full packs on ill-made and snow-covered roads over hilly
country. At the end of the march they found themselves
in villages (four or five of them to the regiment), billetted
in barns, usually without fire, fuel or food. They huddled
together for the body warmth, and sought refuge from cold
and hunger in sleep. When the wagons came in, their food
supplies were fresh meat and fresh vegetables, all frozen
through and needing so much time to cook that many of
the men refused to rise in the night to eat it. Breakfast
was the one real meal; at midday the mess call blew, but
there was nothing to eat.</p>

<p>When they got up in the morning their shoes were frozen
stiff and they had to burn paper and straw in them before
they could get them on. Men hiked with frozen feet, with
shoes so broken that their feet were in the snow; many
could be seen in wooden sabots or with their feet wrapped
in burlap. Hands got so cold and frost-bitten that the
rifles almost dropped from their fingers. Soldiers fell in
the snow and arose and staggered on and dropped again.
The strong helped the weak by encouragement, by sharp
biting words when sympathy would only increase weakness,
and by the practical help of sharing their burdens.
They got through on spirit. The tasks were impossible
for mere flesh and blood, but what flesh and blood cannot
do, spirit can make them do. It was like a battle. We had
losses as in a battle—men who were carried to hospitals
because they had kept going long after their normal powers
were expended. It was a terrible experience. But one
thing we all feel now—we have not the slightest doubt
that men who have shown the endurance that these men
have shown will give a good account of themselves in any
kind of battle they are put into.</p>

<h3>LONGEAU</h3>


<p class="right"><em>January</em> 10th, 1918</p>


<p>The Regiment is in five villages south of the old Fortress
town of Langres in the Haute Marne; Headquarters and
Supply in Longeau, 1st Battalion in Percey, 2nd in Cohons,
the 3rd in Baissey and the Machine Gun Company in
Brennes. They are pleasant prosperous little places (inhabited
by <em>cultivateurs</em> with a sprinkling of <em>bourgeois</em>) the
red roofs clustering picturesquely along the lower slopes of
the rolling country. None of them is more than an hour’s
walk from our center at Longeau. The men are mostly in
the usual hayloft billets, though some companies have
Adrian barracks where they sleep on board floors. Apart
from sore feet from that abominable hike, and the suffering
from cold due to the difficulty of procuring fuel, we are
fairly comfortable.</p>

<p>The officers are living in comparative luxury. I am established
with a nice sweet elderly lady. I reach the house
through a court that runs back of a saloon—which leaves
me open to comments from the ungodly. The house is a
model of neatness, as Madame is a childless widow, and
after the manner of such, has espoused herself to her home.
She is very devout, and glad to have M. l’Aumonier in the
house, but I am a sore trial to her, as I have a constant run
of callers, all of them wearing muddy hobnailed brogans.
She says nothing to me, but I can hear her at all hours of
the day lecturing little Mac about doors and windows and
sawdust and dirt. I never hear him say anything in reply,
except “Oui, Madame,” but somehow he seems to understand
her voluble French and they get along very well together.
I notice that our lads always strike up a quick
acquaintance with the motherly French women. They work
together, cooking at the fireplaces or washing clothes in
the community fountain, keeping up some sort of friendly
gossip and laughing all the while, though I never can understand
how they manage it, for the villagers never learn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
any English and the soldiers have not more than forty words
of French. After all a language is only a makeshift for
expressing ourselves. “Qu’est-ce que c’est”—“Kesky,” and
pointing supplies the nouns, gestures the verbs, and facial
expressions the adjectives.</p>


<h3>LONGEAU</h3>


<p class="right"><em>January</em> 21st, 1918</p>


<p>Last night the church bells rang at midnight; and waking,
I said: “Bombers overhead!” A minute later I heard
the cry Fire! Fire! and the bugles raising the same alarm.
It was a big stable at the south end of the town—we had
gasoline stored in it and some soldier was careless. The
street was thronged in an instant with running soldiers and
civilians. The village firemen or <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pompiers</i> came running up
at a plowman gait—looked the fire over—and went back to
put on their proper uniforms. One old lad came all the
way from Percey in a gendarme’s chapeau. He could not
properly try to put out a fire in that headgear, so he went
all the way back and arrived at last, puffing but satisfied,
in the big <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pompier</i> nickel-plated helmet. Their big pump
was pulled up to Longeau, and the hose was laid with the
proper amount of ceremony and shouting, and the stream
finally put on the blazing shed. The remainder of the population
displayed little of the proverbial French excitability.
They looked on with the air of men who can enjoy a good
spectacle, happy in the thought that the rich American Government
would have to pay for it.</p>

<p>The soldiers were happy too at having a chance to fight
something. Colonel Barker gave orders in his quiet way,
which Captains Anderson and Mangan put into execution.
The fountain ran out and bucket lines were formed. I am
afraid that some of the contents instead of getting to the
fire was dumped on the gaudy uniforms of the funny old
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pompiers</i>, who insisted upon running around giving orders
that nobody could understand. This is the second French<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
fire we have witnessed and the general verdict is that our
moving picture people have missed the funniest unstudied
episode left in the world by not putting a French village
fire department on the screen. It was a good show in
every way—but incidentally the building was a total loss.</p>


<h3>LONGEAU</h3>


<p class="right"><em>January</em> 25th, 1918</p>


<p>I walked over to Cohons today and dropped in on Company
H. Instead of having to make my visit through the
scattered billets that line the entrance to the valley I found
what looked like the whole Company along the roadside in
vehemently gesticulating groups. I hurried to find what
the trouble might be. “What’s the matter here,” I asked.
Val Dowling, the supply Sergeant, picked a uniform out
of a pile and held it up. “Look at the damn thing? Excuse
me, Father, but you’ll say as bad when you look at it.
They want us to wear this.” He held it out as if it had contagion
in it, and I saw it was a British tunic, brass buttons
and all. I disappointed my audience—I didn’t swear out
loud. “Got nice shiny buttons,” I said. “What’s the matter
with it?” What was the matter with it? Did I know
it was a British uniform? Frank McGlynn of Manhattan
and Bill McGorry of Long Island City were as hot as Bill
Fleming or Pat Travers or Chris O’Keefe or William
Smythe. “They look a little betther this way,” said John
Thornton, holding up one with the buttons clipped off.
“That’s all right,” I said, “but don’t get yourselves into
trouble destroying government property.” “Throuble,” said
Martin Higgins. “What the blazes do they mane by insultin’
min fightin’ for thim like this. I’d stand hangin’
rather than put wan of thim rags on me back.”</p>

<p>I went home in a black mood, all the blacker because I
did not want to say what I felt before the men; and when
I got to mess I found Lawrence, Anderson and Mangan and
young McKenna as sore as myself. We all exploded together,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
and Colonel Barker, at first mildly interested, seemed
to get worried. “Well,” he said, “at least they wouldn’t
object if they had to wear English shoes, would they?”
“No,” I said. “They’d have the satisfaction of stamping
on them.” The laugh at my poor joke ended the discussion,
but I waited after supper to talk with Colonel Barker.
I didn’t want him worried about us, and he naturally
couldn’t know; but I felt he could appreciate our attitude
from his own very strong anti-German feelings. “Colonel,”
I said. “We do not want you to feel that you have a regiment
of divided loyalty or dubious reliability on your
hands. We are all volunteers for this war. If you put
our fellows in line alongside a bunch of Tommies, they
would only fight the harder to show the English who are
the better men, though I would not guarantee that there
would not be an occasional row in a rest camp if we were
billeted with them. There are soldiers with us who left
Ireland to avoid service in the British Army. But as soon
as we got into the war, these men, though not yet citizens,
volunteered to fight under the Stars and Stripes.</p>

<p>“We have our racial feelings, but these do not affect our
loyalty to the United States. You can understand it. There
were times during the past two years when if England had
not restrained her John Bull tendencies on the sea we might
have gotten into a series of difficulties that would have led to
a war with her. In that case Germany would have been
the Ally. You are a soldier, and you would have fought,
suppressing your own dislike for that Ally. But supposing
in the course of the war we were short of tin hats and
they asked you to put on one of those Boche helmets?”</p>

<p>The Colonel whacked the table, stung to sudden anger at
the picture. Then he laughed, “You have a convincing way
of putting things, Father. I’ll see that they clothe my men
hereafter in American uniforms.”</p>

<p>And though, as I found later, many of the offensive
uniforms had been torn to ribbons by the men, nobody<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
ever made any inquiry about “destruction of government
property.”</p>


<h3>PERCEY</h3>


<p class="right"><em>February</em> 2nd, 1918</p>


<p>I usually manage to get to two different towns for my
Church services Sunday mornings. General Lenihan always
picks me up in his machine and goes with me to my
early service, at which he acts as acolyte for the Mass, a
duty which he performs with the correctness of a seminarian,
enhanced by his fine soldierly face and bearing
and his crown of white hair. The men are deeply impressed
by it, and there are few letters that go home that
do not speak of it. He brought me back from Cohons this
morning and dropped me off at Percey, where I had a later
Mass. These French villagers are different from our own
home folks in that they want long services; they seem to
feel that their locality is made little of, if they do not
have everything that city churches can boast, and I sometimes
think, a few extras that local tradition calls for. It
is hard on me, for I am a Low Church kind of Catholic
myself; and besides “soldier’s orisons” are traditionally
short ones. The only consolation I have here in Percey is
that the old septuagenarian who leads the service for the
people sings in such a way that I can render thanks to
Heaven that at last it has been given to my ears to hear
raised in that sacred place the one voice I have ever heard
that is worse than my own.</p>

<p>I called on Donovan this evening and found him sitting
in a big, chilly chamber in the old chateau in front of a
fire that refused to burn. He had had a hard day and was
still busy with orders for the comfort of men and animals.
“Father,” he said, “I have just been thinking that what
novelists call romance is only what men’s memories hold
of the past, with all actual realization of the discomforts
left out, and only the dangers past and difficulties conquered
remaining in imagination. What difference is there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
between us and the fellow who has landed at the Chateau
in Stanley Weyman or Robert Stevenson’s interesting
stories; who has come in after a hard ride and is giving
orders for the baiting of his horse or the feeding of his
retinue, as he sits, with his jackboots pulled down, before
the unwilling fire and snuffs the candle to get sufficient light
to read his orders for the next day’s march.” I get much
comfort from the Major’s monologue. It supplies an excellent
romantic philosophy with which to face the sordid
discomforts which are the most trying part of war.</p>


<h3>BAISSEY</h3>


<p class="right"><em>February</em> 8th, 1918</p>


<p>Over today and dined at Hurley’s mess. Pat Dowling
told of a rather mysterious thing that happened to him while
he was a Sergeant in the regular army. He was sent from
one post to another, a distance of two hundred miles, with
a sealed letter which he delivered to the Commanding Officer,
who opened it, read it, and said: “Sergeant, you will
return to your own post immediately.” “I have often
wondered,” said Pat, “what could have been in that letter.”
“I can tell you,” said Tom Martin, in his quiet way. “Well,
what was in it?” “That letter read, ‘If you like the looks
of this man, keep him.’”</p>


<h3>LONGEAU</h3>


<p class="right"><em>February</em> 10th, 1918</p>


<p>The Regiment has made huge progress in military matters
during the past month. I go over to Cohons and the
new French Chauchat automatics are barking merrily at
the hill that climbs from the road. At Percey I see our
erstwhile baseball artists learning an English overhead bowling
delivery for hurling hand grenades at a pit, where they
explode noisily and harmlessly. At Baissey Major Moynahan
walks me up the steep hill to show me his beautiful system
of trenches, though I see no reflection of his enthusiasm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
in the faces of Jerry Sheehan or Jim Sullivan—they had the
hard job of helping to dig them. West of the town against
the steep base of the highest hill Lieutenants O’Brien and
Cunningham with the 37 mm. or one-pound cannon, and
Lieutenants Walsh and Keveny with the Stokes mortars
are destroying the fair face of nature. Vociferous young
Lieutenants are urging the men to put snap into their
bayonet lunges at stuffed mannikins.</p>

<p>I had a little clash of my own with some of these enthusiastic
youngsters early in the game. In the British
school of the bayonet they teach that the men ought to
be made to curse while doing these exercises. I see neither
grace nor sense in it. If a man swears in the heat of a
battle I don’t even say that God will forgive it; I don’t
believe He would notice it. But this organized blasphemy
is an offense. And it is a farce—a bit of Cockney Drill
Sergeant blugginess to conceal their lack of better qualities.
If they used more brains in their fighting and less blood and
guts they would be further on than they are. Our fellows
will do more in battle by keeping their heads and using the
natural cool courage they have than by working themselves
up into a fictitious rage to hide their fears.</p>

<p>Latterly we have had the excellent services of a Battalion
of French Infantry to help us in our training. They
have been through the whole bloody business and wear that
surest proof of prowess, the Fourragère. I asked some of
the old timers amongst them how much use they had made
of the bayonet. They all said that they had never seen a
case when one line of bayonets met another. Sometimes
they were used in jumping into a trench, but generally
when it came to bayonets one side was running away.</p>

<p>The “Y” is on the job and has some sort of place in each
town. With me is Percy Atkins, a good man with only one
fault—he is working himself to death in spite of my trying
to boss him into taking care of himself.</p>

<p>We have suffered a real pang in the transfer of Colonel
Hine to the Railway Service. It gives a foretaste of what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
we are to be up against in this war. There is evidently to
be no regard for feelings or established relations of dependency
or intimacy, but just put men in where they will
be considered to fit best. I was ready for that after the
battles began, but it is starting already. First Reed, now
Hine. I shall miss Colonel Hine very much—a courteous
gentleman, a thorough soldier, a good friend. He was a
railroad man for many years and they say he is needed
there. God prosper him always wherever he goes.</p>

<p>His successor was picked by General Pershing from his
own staff: Colonel John W. Barker, a West Pointer, who
had seen much service and had been on duty in France
since the beginning of the war. He is a manly man, strong
of face, silent of speech, and courteous of manner. We
have learned to like him already—we always like a good
soldier. We are also beginning to get some real training,
as the weather is more favorable and our officers are getting
back from school.</p>

THE LUNÉVILLE SECTOR</h2>
</div>

<h3>ARBRE HAUT</h3>

<p class="right"><em>March</em> 1st, 1918</p>

<p>The trenches at last! We have all read descriptions
of them and so had our preconceived notions. The novelty
is that we are in a thick woods. You go out from Lunéville
(where we have been having the unwonted joys of city life
for a week or so) along the flat valley of the Vesouze
to Croix-Mare, and east to Camp New York, where some
Adrian barracks, floating like Noah’s Arks in a sea of mud,
house the battalion in reserve; then up a good military road
through the Forest of Parroy to Arbre Haut, where a
deep dugout forty feet underground shelters the Colonel
and his headquarters. A mile further on, at Rouge Bouquet,
one arrives at a Battalion Post of Command dugout
now occupied by Major Donovan, Lieutenants Ames, Irving,
Lacey and Captain Mercier, an energetic, capable and agreeable
officer of the French Mission. Duck-board paths
lead in various directions through peaceful looking woods
to a sinuous line of trenches which were, when we arrived
in them, in considerable need of repair. Company D, under
Captain McKenna, had the honor of being first in the lines.
They were followed by Companies B and A, Company C
being in support. Off duty the men live in mean little
dugouts thinly roofed, poorly floored, wet and cold. But
they are happy at being on the front at last, and look on
the discomforts as part of the game. Their only kick is
that it is too quiet. Their main sport is going out on patrols
by night or day to scout through “No Man’s Land,” to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
cut wires, and stir things up generally. With our artillery
throwing over shells from the rear and our impatient infantry
prodding the enemy, this sector will not be long
a quiet one.</p>


<h3>CROIX-MARE</h3>


<p class="right"><em>March</em> 10th, 1918</p>


<p>We have had our first big blow, and we are still reeling
under the pain and sorrow of it. Our 1st Battalion left
the trenches with few casualties to pay for their ten days of
continuous work at trench and wire mending and night
patrols. Arthur Trayer and John Lyons of Company D
were the first to gain their wound chevrons. On March
5th the 2nd Battalion began to move company by company
from Camp New York. I spent the afternoon before with
each unit attending to their spiritual needs, and ending
the day with a satisfactory feeling of having left nothing
undone. I was with Company E on March 6th and will
always retain a recollection of certain youngsters who stayed
for a little friendly personal chat after confession, like
Arthur Hegney, Eddie Kelly, Steve Navin, Arthur Christfully,
George Adkins, Phil Finn; while Steve Derrig and
Michael Ahearn with Bailey, Halligan and McKiernan
were rounding up the bunch to keep me going.</p>

<p>The Company went out in the early morning of March
7th to relieve Company A, and soon had the position taken
over. About 4 P. M. the enemy began a terrific shelling
with heavy minenwerfers on the position at Rocroi. The
big awkward wabbling aerial torpedoes began coming over,
each making a tremendous hole where it hit and sending
up clouds of earth and showers of stone. Lieutenant Norman,
an old Regular Army man, was in charge of the
platoon, and after seeing that his guards and outposts
were in position, ordered the rest of the men into the dugouts.
While he was in the smaller one a torpedo struck
it fair and destroyed it, burying the two signal men from
Headquarters Company, Arthur Hegney and Edward
Kearney. The Lieutenant barely managed to extricate himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
from the debris and set himself to look after the rest
of his men. He was inspecting the larger dugout alongside
when another huge shell came over, buried itself in the
very top of the cave and exploded, rending the earth from
the supporting beams and filling the whole living space and
entrance with rocks and clay, burying the Lieutenant and
twenty-four men.</p>

<p>Major Donovan of the 1st Battalion was at the Battalion
P. C. with Major Stacom when the bombardment began.
As there were six positions to defend and the shelling
might mean an attack anywhere along the whole line, the
Battalion Commander’s duty was to remain at the middle
of the web with his reserves at hand to control the whole
situation. So Major Donovan requested that as he had no
general responsibilities for the situation he might be permitted
to go down to Rocroi and see what he could do there.
Stacom was unwilling to have anybody else run a risk
that he was not permitted to share himself, but he gave his
consent.</p>

<p>Major Donovan found the men in line contending with a
desperate condition. The trenches were in places levelled
by the bombardment and though the enemy were no longer
hurling their big torpedoes they kept up a violent artillery
attack on the position. The only answer that we could
make to this was from the trench mortars which were
kept going steadily by Lieutenants Walsh and F. McNamara,
Corporal Cudmore, William Murphy, Wisner,
Young, Harvey, P. Garvey, Herbert Shannon, F. Garvey,
DeNair, Robertson and the one pounders under Lieutenant
Cunningham, Sergeants J. J. Ryan and Willermin. One
of their guns was blown clean out of its position.</p>

<p>Corporal Helmer with Privates Raymond, McKenzie,
Cohen, McCormack, O’Meara and Smeltzer were saved
from the dugout and immediately began to work for the
rescue of the others, aided by 1st Sergeant Bailey, Sergeants
William Kelly and Andrew Callahan, Corporals Bernard
Kelly and William Halligan with John Cronin, Thomas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
Murray, James Joyce and John Cowie. They knew that
many of their comrades were dead already but the voices
could still be heard as the yet standing timbers kept the
earth from filling the whole grade. The rescuers were aided
by Lieutenant Buck and three sergeants of Company A,
who had remained until the newly arrived company had
learned its way about the sector. These were Sergeants
William Moore, Daniel O’Connell and Spencer Rossel.
Sergeant Abram Blaustein also hastened up with the pioneer
section, Mackay, Taggart, Schwartz, Adair, Heins, Quinn,
LaClair, Dunn, Gillman and the rest.</p>

<p>Major Donovan found them working like mad in an
entirely exposed position to liberate the men underneath.
A real soldier’s first thought will always be the holding of
his position, so the Major quickly saw to it that the defense
was properly organized. Little Eddie Kelly, a seventeen-year-old
boy, was one of the coolest men in sight, and he
flushed with pleasure when told that he was to have a
place of honor and danger on guard. The work of rescue
was kept going with desperate energy, although there was
but little hope that any more could be saved, as the softened
earth kept slipping down, and it was impossible to make a
firm passage-way. The Engineers were also sent for and
worked through the night to get out bodies for burial but
with only partial success. Meanwhile the defenders of the
trench had to stand a continuous shelling in which little
Kelly was killed, Stephen Navin and Stephen Derrig were
seriously wounded, and Sergeant Kahn, Corporal Smeltzer
and Privates Bowler and Dougherty slightly.</p>

<p>The French military authorities conferred a number of
Croix de Guerre, giving a Corps citation to Corporal Helmer
for working to save his comrades after having been
buried himself, “giving a very fine example of conscience,
devotion and courage.” Division citations went to Major
Donovan, “superior officer who has shown brilliant military
qualities notably on the 7th and 8th of March, 1918, by
giving during the course of a violent bombardment an example<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
of bravery, activity and remarkable presence of mind”;
and to Private James Quigley, who “carried two wounded
men to first aid station under a violent bombardment and
worked all night trying to remove his comrades buried
under a destroyed dugout.” Regimental citations were
given to Lieutenant John Norman, Lieutenants Oscar Buck
and W. Arthur Cunningham, Sergeant William Bailey and
Carl Kahn of Company E, Sergeants William J. Moore,
Daniel O’Connell and Spencer T. Rossell of Company A,
Sergeants Blaustein and Private Charles Jones of H. Q.
Company.</p>

<p>The bodies of Eddie Kelly and Oscar Ammon of Company
F, who was also killed during that night, with those
that could be gotten from the dugout were buried in Croix-Mare
in a plot selected for the purpose near a roadside
Calvary which, from the trees surrounding it, was called
the “Croix de L’Arbre Vert” or “Green Tree Cross.” The
others we left where they fell. Over the ruined dugout
we erected a marble tablet with the inscription, “Here on
the field of honor rest”—and their names.</p>

<p>Company E held those broken trenches with their dead
lying there all of that week and Company L during the
week following. Following is a full list of the dead:
Lieutenant John Norman, Corporal Edward Sullivan,
George Adkins, Michael Ahearn, Patrick Britt, Arthur
Christfully, William Drain, William Ellinger, Philip S.
Finn, Michael Galvin, John J. Haspel, Edward J. Kelly,
James B. Kennedy, Peter Laffey, John J. Le Gall, Charles
T. Luginsland, Frank Meagher, William A. Moylan, William
H. Sage and Robert Snyder of Company E; Arthur V.
Hegney and Edward J. Kearney of Headquarters Company
and Oscar Ammon of Company F.</p>


<h3>ARBRE HAUT</h3>

<p class="right"><em>March</em> 12th, 1918</p>

<p>We have given up hope of getting our dead out of Rocroi—it
would be a task for the Engineers, and it would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
probably mean the loss of many more lives to accomplish
it. Joyce Kilmer’s fine instincts have given us a juster
view of the propriety of letting them rest where they fell.
So I went out today to read the services of the dead and
bless their tomb. Company L is in that position now, and
they too have been subjected to a fierce attack in which
Lieutenant Booth was wounded. He and Lieutenant Baker
and Corporal Lawrence Spencer are in for a Croix de
Guerre for courage in action. Today there was a lot of
sniping going on, so Sergeant John Donoghue and Sergeant
Bill Sheahan wanted to go out to the position with
me. They are two of the finest lads that Ireland has given
us, full of faith and loyalty, and they had it in mind, I
know, to stand each side of me and shield me from harm
with their bodies. Val Roesel, Bert Landzert and Martin
Coneys also insisted that they would make good acolytes for
me. But I selected the littlest one in the crowd, Johnny
McSherry; and little Jack trotted along the trench in front
of me with his head erect while I had to bend my long
back to keep my head out of harm’s way. We came on
Larry Spencer in an outpost position contemplating his
tin hat with a smile of satisfaction. It had a deep dent
in it where a bullet had hit it and then deflected—a fine
souvenir.</p>

<p>We finished our services at the grave and returned. I
lingered a while with Spencer, a youth of remarkable
elevation of character—it is a good thing for a Chaplain
to have somebody to look up to. Back in the woods I
met two new Lieutenants, Bernard Shanley and Edward
Sheffler. Shanley is from the Old Sod. Sheffler is a Chicagoan
of Polish descent, a most likable youth. I gave them
a good start on their careers as warriors by hearing their
confessions.</p>

<p>That reminded me that I had some neglected parishioners
in Company I, so I went over their set of trenches. Around
the P. C. it looks like pictures of the houses of wattles and
clay that represent the architecture of Early Britain. Met<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
Harry Adikes and Ed Battersby and found them easy victims
when I talked confession. Where do the Irish get
such names? Ask Wilton Wharton what his ancestors were
and he will say “Irish”; so will Bob Cousens and Bill Cuffe,
Eddie Willett, Jim Peel or Jim Vail. Charlie Cooper is half
way to being Irish now, and he will be all Irish if he gets
a girl I know. I know how Charlie Garret is Irish,—for
he comes from my neighborhood, and if it were the custom
to adopt the mother’s name in a family he would be Charles
Ryan. The same custom would let anybody know without
his telling it, as he does with his chest out, that George Van
Pelt is Irish too. I saw one swarthy fellow with MIKE
KELLEY in black letters on his gas mask, but on asking him
I found that he was Irish only by abbreviation, as he was
christened Michael Keleshian. Tommy O’Brien made himself
my guide and acolyte for my holy errand; and he first
took me on a tour amongst the supply sergeants and cooks
for he wanted us both well looked after. So when we had
gotten Eddie Joyce, Pat Rogan, Michael O’Brien, Tom
Loftus and Joe Callahan in proper Christian condition for
war or hospitality, we sallied forth around the trenches.</p>

<p>Religion in the trenches has no aid from pealing organ or
stained glass windows, but it is a real and vital thing at
that. The ancestors of most of us kept their religious
life burning brightly as they stole to the proscribed Mass in
a secluded glen, or told their beads by a turf fire; and I find
that religion thrives today in a trench with the diapason of
bursting shells for an organ. I had a word or two for every
man and they were glad to get it; and the consolations of the
old faith for those that were looking for it. It makes a
man feel better about the world and God, and the kind of
people he has put into it to know in conditions like these
such men as Bill Beyer, Fordham College Man; Pat Carroll,
Chauffeur; Tom Brennan, Patrick Collins, whom I am
just beginning to know and to like; Bill Dynan, whom I
have known and liked for a long time; manly Pat Hackett
and athletic Pat Flynn, solid non-coms like Ford, Hennessey,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
McDermott, Murphy, Denis Hogan, Michael Jordan,
Hugh McFadden, not to mention the old Roman 1st
Sergeant Patrick McMinaman. It was the vogue at one
time to say with an air of contempt that religion is a
woman’s affair. I would like to have such people come up
here—if they dared: and say the same thing to the soldiers
of this Company or of this Regiment—if they dared.</p>

<p>The last outpost was an interesting one. It did not exist
when I was in these parts with the 2nd Battalion, as our
friends on the other side had not yet built it for us. But
recently they have sent over one of their G. I. cans (that,
dear reader, means galvanized iron can, which are as big as
a barrel, and which tells the story of what a minenwerfer
torpedo shell looks like when it is coming toward you) and
the G. I. Can made a hole like the excavation of a small
cottage. In it I found four or five of Company I snugly
settled down and very content at being that much closer
to the enemy. Here I met for the first time Ed. Shanahan, a
fine big fellow who ought to make good with us, and
Charlie Stone, whose mother was the last to say good-bye to
me as we left Camp Mills. Mess came up while we were
there and we did justice to it sitting on clumps of soft earth
which had been rolled into round snowballs by the explosion—and
chatting about New York.</p>


<h3>ST. PATRICK’S DAY IN THE TRENCHES</h3>

<p class="right"><em>Sunday</em>, <em>March</em> 17th 1918</p>

<p>What a day this would have been for us if we were back
in New York! Up the Avenue to St. Patrick’s Cathedral in
the morning, and the big organ booming out the old Irish
airs and the venerable old Cardinal uttering words of blessing
and encouragement. And in the afternoon out on
parade with the Irish Societies with the band playing Garry
Owen and Let Erin Remember and O’Donnell Aboo, as we
pass through the cheering crowds. And how they would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
shout in this year of Grace 1918 if we could be suddenly
transported to New York’s Avenue of triumph. But I am
glad we are not there. For more than seventy years the
old Regiment has marched up the Avenue in Church parade
on St. Patrick’s Day. But never, thank God, when the
country was at war. Other New Yorkers may see the
Spring sweeping through the Carolinas or stealing timidly
up the cliffs of the Hudson or along the dented shores of
Long Island; but there is only one place in the world where
the old Irish Regiment has any right to celebrate it, and
that is on the battle line.</p>

<p>The 3rd Battalion is in the trenches, so I went up yesterday
and spent the night with Major Moynahan, who
gave me a true Irish welcome. He and Leslie have made
good Irishmen out of Lieutenants Rerat and Jackson and
we had a pleasant party.</p>

<p>We had not a Cathedral for our St. Patrick’s day Mass
but Lieutenant Austin Lawrence had Jim McCormack and
George Daly of the Medicos pick out a spot for me among
the trees to conceal my bright vestments from observation
and the men who were free slipped up the boyaus from the
nearby trenches for the services.</p>

<p>Later in the morning I said Mass back at Camp New
York for the 2nd Battalion in a grove of young birch
trees on the hill slope, the men being scattered singly over
the slope and holding very still when the bugler sounded
the alert for an enemy aeroplane over head. I described
former St. Patrick days to them and told them they were
better here. New York would talk more of them, think
more of them than if they were back there. Every man in
the town would be saying he wished he were here and
every man worth his salt would mean it. The leading men
of our country had called us to fight for human liberty and
the rights of small nations, and if we rallied to that noble
cause we would establish a claim on our own country and
on humanity in favor of the dear land from which so
many of us had sprung, and which all of us loved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span></p>

<p>In the afternoon we had a fine concert under the trees.
Sergeants Frye and Tom Donahoe played for Tommy McCardle’s
funny songs, and for John Mullin’s serious ones.
McManus and Quinn played the fife for Irish dances, and
Lieutenant Prout, by special request, recited John Locke’s
poem, “Oh Ireland, I Bid You the Top of the Morning.”</p>

<p>In the middle of the concert I read Joyce Kilmer’s noble
poem, “Rouge Bouquet.” The last lines of each verse are
written to respond to the notes of “Taps,” the bugle call
for the end of the day which is also blown ere the last sods
are dropped on the graves of the dead. Sergeant Patrick
Stokes stood near me with his horn and blew the tender
plaintive notes before I read the words; and then from the
deep woods where Egan was stationed came a repetition
of the notes “like horns from elfland faintly blowing.”
Before I had finished tears had started in many an eye especially
amongst the lads of Company E. I had known it was
going to be a sad moment for all, and had directed the band
to follow me up with a medley of rollicking Irish airs; just
as in military funerals the band leads the march to the
grave in solemn cadence and departs playing a lively tune.
It is the only spirit for warriors with battles yet to fight.
We can pay tribute to our dead but we must not lament for
them overmuch.</p>


<h3>CROIX-MARE</h3>


<p class="right"><em>March</em> 18th, 1918</p>


<p>I buried a soldier of the 117th Signal Battalion in Croix-Mare
today with unusual honors. Private Wilkerson had
been killed in action and as he was a Catholic Major Garrett
had asked me to perform the ceremony. The French
were most kind in participating, but that is no new thing.
Colonel Dussauge always has his Chasseurs take part with
us in funerals, though it is a distraction to me to see them
trying to accommodate their short choppy gait (“like soldiers
in the Movies” according to Bandsman McGregor)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
to the air of a Dead March. I said to the Colonel: “There
is one thing your men can’t do.” “What is that?” “Walk
to a funeral march.” “Thank you for the compliment,
Monsieur l’Aumonier.” The Curé, too, always came
to our funerals. And we had a fine grizzled old Oblate
Division Chaplain who has been in all the French wars from
Madagascar to Tonquin. The Government tried to put him
out of France when the law against Religious was passed,
but he refused to go, saying he would live his life in
France if he had to live it in jail. I met a number of
these religious in the army, most of them returned from exile
to offer their lives in defense of their country. If the
French Government puts them out after the war is over
they will deserve the scorn and enmity of mankind as a
rotten set of ingrates.</p>

<p>At the grave we found we had other spectators. I saw
General Menoher and General Lenihan with a short spare-built
civilian whom I took for a reporter. He had a French
gas mask with a long tape, which hung down between his
legs like a Highlander’s sporran. There were Moving Picture
cameras too, which seemed to spell a Presence. I
whispered to the old Curé that his picture would be put on
the screen in every town in America, at which he was, I
could see, somewhat shocked and altogether pleased. After
the ceremony a number of the Signal Battalion took advantage
of the opportunity to go to confession; and I was standing
by the side of a truck performing my pious duties when
General Lenihan approached with the slim reporter. They
did not intrude, so I missed my chance of making the
acquaintance of the energetic Newton W. Baker, Secretary
of War of the United States.</p>


<h3>LUNÉVILLE</h3>

<p class="right"><em>March</em> 21st, 1918</p>

<p>For the past twelve days volunteers from the 1st Battalion
have been preparing, under command of Lieutenants Henry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
A. Bootz and Raymond H. Newton, for a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup de main</i>
in connection with the 41st Battalion of Chasseurs. They
have been training with the French at Croix-Mare and I find
it interesting to watch them. They go through all sorts
of athletic stunts to get into perfect condition, study the
ground through maps on the blackboard showing just what
each man’s position is to be, and then work out the whole
thing over a ground which is very much like the Ouvrage
Blanc, where the raid will take place.</p>

<p>Last Saturday afternoon, after I had been hearing confessions
amongst them, four or five of the Irish lads waited
to see me. I went for a walk with them around an old
moat and as we stood looking at a stone tablet that commemorated
the victory of some Duke of Lorraine over a
Duke of Burgundy four hundred years ago, Billy Elwood
put the question, “Father, do you think we’ll be afraid?”
“Not you,” I said, “not a bit of it. You may feel rather
tight across the chest for the five minutes before you tear
into it, but when you get going you’ll forget even that, because
your blood will be up.” “I believe you,” he said.
“Of course you know none of us are afraid and we are all
anxious to have a try at it, but it’s our first time in a thing
of this sort and the only worry we have is that something
might go wrong inside of us and spoil the good name of the
Irish.”</p>

<p>Before the raid started there was an amusing little interlude.
Corporal Bob Foster of Company D had a little Irish
flag given to him by Sergeant Evers of the Band, and the
lads were determined that that flag would go over the top in
the first organized attack made by the regiment. A young
officer, not of our Division, who had been sent as an observer,
saw the flag stuck at the top of Foster’s rifle and felt
it his duty to protest against it. After a short parley Bootz
demanded, “What are you here for, anyway.” “I’m an
observer,” was the response. “Then climb a tree and observe,
and let me run this raid.”</p>

<p>Our artillery was busy bombarding the position that was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
to be the object of assault and at 7:35 P. M. the men
went out through our wires under cover of darkness and
took up their position near the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chicanes</i> (passages) in the
enemy wire, which had been reconnoitered the night before.
Our artillery laid down a barrage at 7:50 for a space
of three minutes upon which the front line advanced and
got possession of the German trenches without opposition,
as the Germans had evacuated them during the heavy bombardment
of the past two days. They were just in time in
reaching shelter for the German artillery began to shell
their own abandoned line most vigorously. The trouble
about this attack was that our own artillery preparation had
been too good. The Germans could not help inferring
that this point was to be made the object of an assault, so
they drew back and waited until the infantry had reached
the position. Then they turned on them the full force of
artillery and machine gun fire from positions further back,
leaving to the assaulters the choice between getting back to
their own lines, or attacking an unknown and well defended
position in the dark. The French Officer in charge gave
the order to retire. During this period Edward Maher of
Company B must have been killed because no word of him
was ever received. Corporal William Elwood and Joseph
Miller of Company C were fatally wounded. Badly
wounded were Sergeants John F. Scully, Fred Almendinger
and Martin Gill of Company A and Patrick Grogan of
Company D. After getting back to the French trenches
Bootz and Newton repeatedly led parties back over the shell-swept
area to search for Maher, and to see if the Germans
had reoccupied their trenches. On this mission Thomas P.
Minogue of Company B was killed. Lieutenant Newton
carried in one French soldier and Private Plant carried in
another. Lieutenant Bootz, with Corporal Joseph Pettit
of Company C, helped Sergeant Scully to the lines, and
going out again, they found Joe Miller, his right leg amputated
by a shell. Miller was a big man but Bootz swung<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
him up on his back and with Pettit assisting, carried him
back into the lines.</p>

<p>The following officers and men taking part in this <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup
de main</i> were decorated by the French authorities on March
22nd at Croix-Mare: Division Citations, First Lieutenant
Henry A. Bootz, Second Lieutenant Raymond H. Newton,
Private Marlow Plant; Regimental Citations: Company A,
Joseph C. Pettit, Frank J. Fisher, Privates George McCarthy,
Bernard McOwen, Michael Morley, Sergeant John
Scully; Company B, Sergeants Spiros Thomas, Christian
Biorndall, Corporal William F. Judge, Privates Frank
Brandreth, Vincent J. Eckas, Daniel J. Finnegan; Company
C, Sergeant Eugene A. McNiff, Corporal Herman E. Hillig,
Privates Bernard Barry, Michael Cooney, James Barry,
John J. Brawley, Joseph A. Miller; Company D, Sergeant
Thomas M. O’Malley, Corporal Thomas H. Brown, Privates
Denis O’Connor, Patrick Grogan, John Cahill, Harry
H. DeVoe.</p>

<p>Of the wounded, Elwood died shortly after being brought
to the Hospital at Lunéville and Joe Miller succumbed the
next day after sufferings borne with a fortitude that begot
the admiration of nurses and doctors used to dealing with
courageous men. The others are wounded badly enough
but they will recover. Almendinger, who describes himself
as “half Boche and half County Kilkenny,” was going
off to the operating ward to have his wounded eye removed
when I saw him the second time. “Never mind
about that, Fred,” I said, “Uncle Sam will look after you.”
“I’m not thinking about Uncle Sam at all. There’s a girl
back in New York who doesn’t care whether I have one
eye or two, so I should worry.”</p>


<h3>THE GAS ATTACK</h3>

<p class="right"><em>March</em> 20th and 21st, 1918</p>

<p>But meanwhile there had been other happenings in the
sector which quite overshadowed the 1st Battalion raid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span></p>

<p>Company K went into the line in the Rouge Bouquet
Sector on March 12th, 1918, relieving Company H. The
Company Headquarters were at Chaussailles, and the two
platoons in the front line were: on the right, at Changarnier
(C. R. 1), one platoon; in the center at C. R. 2 a
half platoon; and on the left at Chevert (C. R. 3) a half
platoon.</p>

<p>There were no casualties for the first eight days except
that John Ring received a bullet in the arm. Our patrols
did not come into contact with the Boches (who apparently
never left their lines) and except a few minenwerfer and
some shelling with 77’s the sector was quiet, the weather
was fine, and every one spoke of the tour at the front as a
picnic.</p>

<p>About 5:30 on the evening of the 20th the Boches suddenly
began to bombard the entire company sector, from a
line not far from their own trenches to a line several hundred
yards in the rear of Company Headquarters, with
mustard gas shells and shrapnel, the heaviest bombardment
being in the vicinity of C. R. 2, where Sergeant Frank
Doughney was in command, of C. R. 3, where Lieutenant
Bill Crane was in command, and at the first aid station,
where Lieutenant Patten and his group were quartered,
together with the fourth platoon under Lieutenant Levi.
This bombardment lasted about three hours.</p>

<p>The groups stationed at the outposts were caught on
their way in, the two groups under Corporals Caulfield and
Joe Farrell being led by Corporal Farrell into an incomplete
dugout about 300 yards in front of our lines, the other
two going directly in.</p>

<p>The second platoon, under Lieutenant Dowling in Changarnier,
were not so heavily shelled and being on higher
ground, were not gassed so badly as the others.</p>

<p>In C. R. 2, Harry McCoun was struck by a shell which
carried away his left hand. He held up the stump and
shouted, “Well, boys, there goes my left wing.” Sergeant
Jack Ross and Private Ted Van Yorx led him under heavy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
fire back to the first aid station, where Doctor Patten
tore off his mask to operate on him (for which he earned
the Croix de Guerre), but McCoun died the next morning.</p>

<p>In C. R. 3, Lieutenant Crane walked from one post to
the other in the midst of the heaviest bombardment in order
to encourage the men. In the midst of this bombardment,
several of the runners, including particularly Privates Ed
Rooney and Ray Staber, distinguished themselves by their
courage and coolness in carrying messages between Company
headquarters and the front line.</p>

<p>The men were prompt in putting on their masks as soon
as the presence of gas was recognized, but it was found
impossible to keep them on indefinitely and at the same
time keep up the defense of the sector. Immediately after
the bombardment, the entire company area reeked with the
odor of mustard-gas and this condition lasted for several
days. It had been raining heavily the night before, and
there was no breeze whatever.</p>

<p>By about midnight some of the men were sick as a result
of the gas, and as the night wore on, one after another they
began to feel its effects on their eyes, to cry, and gradually
to go blind, so that by dawn a considerable number from
the front line had been led all the way back and were sitting
by the Lunéville road, completely blinded, and waiting their
turn at an ambulance, and the third platoon were unable
to furnish enough men to man all their posts and were
compelled to ask for replacements.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, about ten o’clock at night, the first and
fourth platoons had been ordered to leave their reserve
positions and march back to the Lunéville road and down
the cross-road on the other side where they lay down in the
mud and slept till morning. In the morning they filtered
down to replace the casualties in the other two platoons.</p>

<p>About three o’clock in the morning Lieutenant (Doctor)
Martin came down in the midst of the gas to relieve Lieutenant
Patten, who had been blinded and taken to the hospital.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
Lieutenant Martin was himself affected by the gas
and went blind on the following morning.</p>

<p>By dawn, the men were going blind one after another,
and being ordered to the hospital. Often, by the time
they got to the ambulance, the man leading was himself
blind and both got into the ambulance together. Not a
man lost his head or lay down on the job and not a man
left for the hospital until he was stone blind, or ordered to
go by an officer, and a number of men were blinded while
on post, while others stuck it out for so long that it was
finally necessary to carry them on stretchers to the dressing
station; and this although all had been instructed that
mustard gas was one of the most deadly gases and that
it caused blindness which lasted for months and was in
many cases permanent.</p>

<p>By ten o’clock in the morning fully two-thirds of the
company had been blinded, and about this time Lieutenants
Crane, Dowling and Levi, and Captain Hurley one after
the other went blind and were led back, followed later by
Lieutenant Burns.</p>

<p>Throughout the day the men continued to go blind, until
by seven o’clock only about thirty were left, almost all of
whom were in the front line, under command of Lieutenant
Tom Martin, and they were so few that it was necessary
for them to go on post for four hours at a stretch, with
two hours off, and some of them, including Tom Hickey,
Barney Furey, John McLoughlin, Pat McConnell and Jerry
O’Connor were on post for as long as six hours at a
time.</p>

<p>At seven o’clock Lieutenant Hunt Warner, with Lieutenant
Zipp, appeared with reinforcements, consisting of
forty men from Company M. Lieutenant Warner was put
in command at Chevert with Sergeant Embrie of Company
K, as second in command; Sergeant Von Glahn of Company
M, was put in command at C. R. 2, where the gas
was at that time especially heavy; and Lieutenant Zipp was
put in command at Changarnier, with Corporal Joe Farrell,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
who knew the sector thoroughly and spent the night
going from one post to another, as second in command,
Lieutenant Tom Martin at Changarnier being in command
of the whole company sector.</p>

<p>That evening about dusk the men in the front line heard
an explosion in the rear and looked back in time to see
the battalion ammunition dump go up in a blaze of glory, on
seeing which all broke into applause and loud cheers. It
was thought that the Boches might be so foolish as to
think the evening propitious for a raid, and all posts were
manned and all were ready to give him a warm reception,
but he failed to show up.</p>

<p>At seven next morning the French appeared and the
relief was completed by about nine o’clock, when the survivors
set out for Lunéville, where they were taken in hand
by Lieutenant Arnold, who ordered them all, much against
their protest, to a hospital where they were surprised to
find that they were casualties, their injuries consisting principally
of burns on the body, which had just begun to show
up, and which kept most of them in the hospital for at least
a month.</p>

<p>On their arrival at the hospital they found there some
of the French troops who had relieved them on that morning
and who had already become casualties because of the
gas which lingered in the area.</p>

<p>The men killed, besides McCoun, were Salvatore Moresea,
whose body was found by the French in No Man’s
Land the day after the Company was relieved, Carl Braun,
of Headquarters Company, hit by bullet, with Robert Allen,
Walter Bigger, and Lawrence Gavin, who died in the hospital
within a day or two as a result of the effect of the gas
on their lungs. About four hundred of our men were put
out of action in this gas attack including practically all of
K Company, many of M, and some from Headquarters,
Supply and Medical.</p>

<p>The event had one consoling feature, and that was the
superb conduct of the men. They had been told most awful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
stories of the effect of gas. When they found that their
whole position was saturated with it, they felt that their
chances to live through it were slender, and that they would
surely be blind for a long time. And yet not a single man
quit his post until ordered. There was no disorder or panic;
the men of Company K were forced to quit their position,
but they quit it one by one, and every man was a subject
for a hospital long before he left. And the Company M
men coming up to take over the position, and seeing the
blinded and tortured soldiers going back, had courage in
equal measure. Soldiers that will stand up to it as these
had done under the terrors and sufferings of that night
can be relied on for anything that men can be called on to
do.</p>


<h3>LUNÉVILLE</h3>

<p class="right"><em>March</em> 23rd, 1918</p>

<p>We are quitting this sector and going back to the Langres
area to rest up a bit and study out the lessons we have
learned. Most of the companies have started already. The
Germans are shelling this city today for the first time in
over three years. It is an interesting experience to be in a
shelled city, and, so far as I can see the results, not a particularly
dangerous one.</p>


<h3>ST. BOINGT</h3>

<p class="right"><em>Palm Sunday</em>, 1918</p>

<p>This has been an ideal Spring day. I said Mass in the
village church for the “4th Battalion” (Headquarters, Machine
Gun, Sanitary and Supply Companies). Later in the
morning Major Lawrence and I dropped in to the High
Mass. I was interested in the palms. When I was a lad we
used cedar, before the days when ships from the Spanish
Main brought their cargoes of broad palmetto leaves, which
we carry in our hands on Palm Sunday and wear in our
hats through Holy Week. Here they use anything fresh,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
young and growing, that the country and the season afford.
The people pluck small branches from the trees on their
way to Mass, the preference being for willow shoots with
their shiny yellow green bark and furry buds. There is a
fine old-world countryside flavor to this custom of plucking
these offerings to the Lord from one’s own trees or along
familiar lanes, that we never get from our boughten palms.</p>

<p>This I felt especially when I saw what they were doing
with them. When the procession began, everybody arose
and followed the crossbearer out of the church portals into
the mellow spring morning. Around the church they went,
their ranks now swelled by a crowd of our own soldiers.
Our route lay through the graves of the village dead. At
each grave a lone figure or a small group would detach themselves
and kneel in prayer while they stuck their fresh young
twigs in the soil around it. We too found a place for our
offerings and prayers when we came to a recently made
mound with a Croix de Guerre and bronze palm embossed
upon its stone—a French soldier, “Mort pour la Patrie.”
We borrowed pussy willows from the people and pulled
branches of green box, and covered that grave with them
while we made our soldier’s orisons for the man that was
sleeping there, and for our own fine lads that we had left
behind in the dugout at Rocroi and under the Green Tree
Cross at Croix-Mare.</p>

<p>After Mass I started off across the fields to visit the 2nd
Battalion at Essey la Cote. A wonderful spring day—fresh
and sweet and clear. From the hill one could see
the dull red tiles of twenty villages clustering along the
slopes of the rolling landscape. Faint sounds of distant
church bells came to my ears; and nearer, clearer notes
from overhead such as I had never heard before. Skylarks!
It was the final touch to make it a perfect morning.</p>

<p>I dropped down to the road which led to the nestling
village, and met a band of children romping out. Here too
was spring. They gathered round me, not at all shy, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
they were bubbling with excitement and anxious to talk.
The American soldiers—they were so—big-and so young—and
so nice—and so devout (they filled the church at three
Masses)—and so rich (they gave money like nobody had
ever seen before, and the Commandant had put a twenty
franc note on the collection plate). “Good Old Bill Stacom,”
I mused, “we are both far away from our little
parish in the Bronx, but he has not forgotten my teachings
on the first duty of the laity.”</p>

<p>I dined with Captain Jim Finn and his happy family of
bright young Lieutenants—Sherman Platt and Becker and
Otto and Flynn, clean cut active youngsters who enjoy their
work and are delighted at serving with the old Regiment.
I spent the afternoon amongst the men. They too were
enjoying the day lazily, cleaning up equipment in chatty
groups or propped against sunny walls, or wandering
through the fields. They have heard of the big German
Drive in the north and they know that we have been halted
and are to be sent in somewhere. They are somewhat disappointed
at not getting back to Longeau and Baissey and
Cohons and Percey once more, but if there is anything big
happening they don’t want to miss it. That’s what we are
here for.</p>

<p>Billy Kaas offered to be my guide to the hilltop, from
which the whole countryside can be seen for miles around.
The spot is interesting for other reasons. It marks the
high water level of the German invasion of Lorraine in
1914, and now it marks the furthest backward step we are
to make on this journey. I feel prophetic twitchings that
it will be a long long time before we are allowed to pitch
our tents in that part of France over there which has not
known invasion by the enemy. The news from the North
is grave, and our side will need every soldier it has if the
Germans are to be held off. And that is a job that will take
a lot of doing. Well, as the men say, “that’s what we are
here for.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span></p>


<h3>ST. REMY AUX BOIS</h3>

<p class="right"><em>March</em> 27th, 1918</p>

<p>Dropped over in the morning to call on the First Battalion.
I found them in the field, where Donovan had had
them lined up for a cross country run. I prudently kept
out of his way until he was off with his wild youngsters,
and then I looked up George McAdie, who had a stay-at-home
duty. Reilley and Kennedy and McKenna were cavorting
cross country with the rest. Good enough for them—athletics
is a big part of their lives. But George and I
are philosophers. So while Donovan led his gang across
brooks and barbwire fences and over hills and through
woods, George and I sat discussing the most interesting
beings in the world; soldier men—their loyalty, courage,
humor, their fits of laziness and sulkiness. He pointed
out to me a dark Celt who had been discontented with the
mean drudgery of a soldier’s life and was hard to manage.
Different methods had been tried to jack him up. All
failed until the Captain gave him a chance to go over in
the Lunéville raid. At last he found something the lad
was eager about. He went through the training with cheerfulness,
distinguished himself under fire for his cool alacrity,
and is now playing the game like a veteran.</p>

<p>Finally the harriers got back, the Major the freshest man
amongst them. “Oh, Father,” he said, “why didn’t you get
here earlier? You missed a fine time.” “My Guardian
Angel was taking good care of me, William,” I said, “and
saw to it that I got here late.”</p>

<p>In the afternoon the band came over and we had a band
concert in the church square and afterwards a vaudeville
show given by the men. The Major was asked to say
something and he smilingly passed the buck to me. I got
square by telling the story of a Major who had been shot
at by a German sniper while visiting one of his companies
in the trenches. He made a big fuss about it with the
Captain, who in turn bawled out an old sergeant for allowing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
such things to happen. The sergeant went himself to
settle the Heinie that was raising all the trouble. Finally
he got sight of his man, took careful aim and fired. As
he saw his shot reach home, he muttered, “Take that, confound
you, for missing the Major.”</p>


<h3>BACCARAT</h3>

<p class="right"><em>Easter Sunday Night</em></p>

<p>Yesterday we were at Xaffévillers, Magnières and St.
Pierremont. For my Easter celebration I picked Magnières,
as the whole 2nd Battalion was there and two companies of
the 1st in St. Pierremont, only ten minutes away. For confessions
I set up shop in the street at the crossways, and I
had a busy day of it. There was always a long file waiting,
but when nobody has much to tell the task is soon sped.</p>

<p>I stayed with Stacom. It is always a pleasure to be with
Stacom and his officers. He has a way of kindly mastery
that begets affectionate loyalty. A man likes Stacom even
when he is getting a call down from him. At supper with
Doc Houghton, Joe O’Donohue, Arthur Martin, McDermott,
Fechheimer, Landrigan, Ewing Philbin, Billy Burns
Guggenheim, and Joe McNamara. A man might search the
list of all his acquaintances and not find a set of men so congenial
and happily disposed.</p>

<p>I looked up the Curé, an alert slender youngish man
with a keen intelligent face, a soldier just back that day
<em>en permission</em> to keep the old feast with his own people.
The Germans had held him as a hostage in 1914 and had
thrice threatened to shoot him, though he had looked after
their wounded. If thoroughness was their motto they
would have been wiser to do it, I reflected as I talked with
him; for he was a man that would count wherever he went,
and he certainly had no use for Germans. “Too big a man
for this place. We won’t be able to keep him long,” said
Stacom’s landlady, a pleasant thoughtful woman, whose
son of seventeen was just back for the holidays from some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
college where he is beginning his studies for the priesthood.</p>

<p>The village church was a ruin. Both sides had used it to
fight from and both sides had helped to wreck it. The roof
was gone and most of the side walls. The central tower
over the entrance still stood, though the wooden beams above
had burned, and the two big bells had dropped clean through
onto the floor. The Curé used a meeting-room in the town
hall for his services, but that would not do for my congregation.
The church faced a long paved square, so I
decided to set up my altar in the entrance and have the
men hear Mass in the square. The church steps served
excellently for Communion. It is one of the things I wish
I had a picture of—my first Easter service in France; the
old ruined church for a background, the simple altar in the
doorway, and in front that sea of devout young faces paying
their homage to the Risen Savior. My text lay around
me—the desecrated temple, the soldier priest by my side, the
uniforms we wore, the hope of triumph over evil that the
Feast inspired, the motive that brought us here to put an end
to this terrible business of destruction, and make peace
prevail in the world. Here more than a thousand soldiers
were present, and the great majority crowded forward at
Communion time to receive the Bread of Life.</p>

<p>I hiked it into Baccarat with the Battalion. At a point on
the road the separated elements of the Regiment met and
swung in behind each other. Colonel Barker stopped his
horse on a bank above the road and watched his men go by,
with feelings of pride in their fine appearance and the
knowledge of how cheerfully they had given up their prospects
of a rest and were going back into the lines again.
With his usual kind courtesy, he wanted to have me ride,
but for once I preferred to hike, as I was having a good
time.</p>

<p>Arriving in Baccarat I ran into Captain Jack Mangan,—always
a joyous encounter. We found a hotel and something
to eat; met there Major Wheeler, Ordnance Officer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
of Division, a Southerner of the finest type. I tried to start
a row between him and Mangan. I always like to hear these
supply people fight—they battle with each other with such
genial vigor. When they began to swap compliments I left
them, to look up the Y. M. C. A. to see if there were religious
services in town that I could announce to my Protestant
fellows.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br>
THE BACCARAT SECTOR</h2>
</div>

<h3>BACCARAT</h3>

<p class="right"><em>March</em>, 1918</p>

<p>To speak in guide-book fashion, Baccarat is a town of
15,000 people situated in the wide, flat valley of the Meurthe
River. It possesses a well-known glass factory and a rather
elegant parish church, whose elegance is just now slightly
marred by two clean shell-shots, one through its square
tower and the other through the octagonal spire. The most
extensive ruins, dating from the German capture of the
town in 1914, are those of the blocks on both sides of the
street between the church and the river. They were caused,
not by shell fire, but by deliberate arson, for some actions of
the townspeople, real or fancied. A few broken walls are
standing with all the chimneys still intact, sticking up
amongst them like totem poles. Charlie Brooks, making
believe that the ruins were caused by shell fire, said to me
“In case of bombardment, I know the safest place to get.
Sit right up on top of a chimney and let them shoot
away.”</p>

<p>West of the river the hill rises steeply and is crowned by
the picturesque old walled village of Deneuvre, dating certainly
from the early Middle Ages, and, local antiquarians
say, from Roman times. Here are established our regimental
headquarters, with the four special companies, and
the whole of the third battalion, or what is left of it, as
Company K consists of Lieutenant Howard Arnold, Sergeant
Embree, Company Clerk Michael Costello and two
privates, who were absent on other duties when the Company<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
was gassed; and Company M is reduced to half its
strength. The first battalion is very comfortably situated
in the Haxo Barracks at the north end of Baccarat, the
2nd Battalion being at present at Neufmaisons, ten kilometers
out toward the front lines. The regiment was selected
as division reserve on account of the depleted strength
of our 3rd Battalion.</p>


<h3>BACCARAT</h3>


<p class="right"><em>April</em> 2, 1918</p>


<p>At last we have located the gassed members of our 3rd
Battalion in the hospitals at Vittel and Contrexéville; and
today, as Lieutenant Knowles had the kindly thought of
bringing their pay to them, Donovan, Mangan and myself
took advantage of the opportunity to go and see them. The
hospitals were formerly hotels in these summer resorts and
serve excellently for their present purpose. Many of the
men are still in bed, lying with wet cloths over their poor
eyes, and many of them have been terribly burned about the
body, especially those whose duties called upon them to
make exertions which used perspiration. Among these is
John McGuire of the Supply Company and many of the
sanitary detachment, such as Sergeant Lokker, Ed. McSherry,
James Butler, Michael Corbett and John J. Tierney,
who have been recommended for the Croix de Guerre for
courage and devotion in saving the wounded. Sergeant
Russell, with Corporals Beall and Brochon of the Headquarters
Company are also suffering for their zeal in maintaining
liaison.</p>

<p>But it is Company K that had to bear the brunt of it. Of
the officers, Lieutenant Crane is in the most critical condition,
and it was a touching thing as I went through the
ward to hear every single man in his platoon forget his
own pain to inquire about the Lieutenant. Some of the
men are still in very bad shape, Richard O’Gorman, George
Sicklick, Val Prang, Sergeant Gleason, Bernard Leavy,
Francis Meade, James Mullin and also Mortimer Lynch,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
Christopher Byrne, Daniel Dooley, Gerard Buckley, Harold
Benham, Harold Broe, Kilner McLaughlin, and Buglers Nye
and Rice. The cooks did not escape—Pat Boland, William
Mulcahy, Moriarty, Thomas O’Donnell and Michael
O’Rourke, who, by the way, is one of those Czecho-Slovaks
who has chosen to fight under a martial name. The Wisconsins
also have been hard hit, and two of their men here,
Corporal John Sullivan and Leo Moquin, are painfully
burned on account of their exertions in carrying others. I
have turned the names of these two in with a recommendation
for citation, with those of Staber, Farrell, Ross, Van
Yorx, Montross, Beall, Brochon, McCabe and the medicos
mentioned. Sergeant Leo Bonnard, in liaison with the
French, has received his cross on their recommendation.
Lieutenant Tom Martin and Dr. Patton also received the
same decoration.</p>

<p>Apart from Lieutenant Crane, none of the officers is in
serious condition, though more than half of the officers in
the battalion are in the hospital, including Major Moynahan,
Captains Hurley, Merle-Smith, and Meaney, Lieutenants
Leslie, Stevens, and Rerat, with nearly all the lieutenants
of Company K and M, and also Major Lawrence with
Lieutenants Patton and Arthur Martin of the Sanitary Detachment,
who deserve high praise for their handling of a
difficult situation.</p>

<p>The Company M men were not so badly gassed, with
the exception of Sergeant Emerson. A good many of them
were walking about with eyes only slightly inflamed. I was
immediately surrounded by Eustace, Flanigan, Jack Manson,
Harry Messmer, Bill Lanigan, Mark White, Jock Cameron
and a lot of others, all clamoring for news about the
regiment. I made myself a candidate for being canonized
as a saint by working at least a hundred first-class miracles
when I announced that we had come with the pay. The
news was received with a shout, “Gimme me pants, I’m
all better now.”</p>

<p>There was one thing that disturbed us. We found most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
of our injured in these two towns, but there was still a considerable
number whose pay we had that we could not find,
and nobody was able to tell where they had been sent.</p>


<h3>BACCARAT</h3>


<p class="right"><em>April</em> 7th, 1918</p>


<p>The reports which have arrived of the death in hospital
of Robert Allen, Walter Bigger and Lawrence Gavin of
Company K gave us our first information concerning the
whereabouts of soldiers whom we could not discover in our
trip to the hospital. They died at the new Army Hospital
at Bazoilles near Neufchateau. As Tom Johnson of the
New York <cite>Sun</cite> was visiting us, he offered to take me back
with him in his car to see them. They are in long, one-story
hospital barracks and most of them are almost recovered
although Amos Dow and Herbert Kelly are still
very sick boys. With the assistance of the two First Sergeants
of K and M, Tim Sullivan and James McGarvey,
who are also patients, I paid them all off.</p>

<p>I also gave them a bit of news which was more gratefully
received than the pay, and that is saying a great deal.
One of the hospital authorities told me that a special order
had arrived that men of the 165th who would be fit for
duty by a certain date should be returned direct to the regiment
without going through a casual camp. He told me
also that the order was entirely an exceptional one, adding
laughingly that he would be glad to get rid of them. He
said they were the liveliest and most interesting lot of
patients he ever had to deal with, but they made themselves
infernal pests by agitating all the time to get back to their
confounded old regiment. Howard Gregory came up with
a side car to take me back and I had another chance to see
our men in the other two hospitals and was glad to find
that they are all on the road to recovery.</p>

<h3>REHERREY</h3>


<p class="right"><em>April</em> 25th, 1918</p>


<p>On April 23rd, and a miserable day of rain and mud it
was, we relieved the Ohios in the positions on the left of
our Division Sector. Looking east from Baccarat one sees
only a steep hill which forms the valley of the Meurthe and
blocks the view in the direction of the combat line; but a
road from the north of the town leads through an opening
in the hills to undulating country with small villages dotting
the landscape every two or three miles. One of these is
Reherrey, which is to be our regimental P. C. during our
stay in this section. The next village to the east, called
Migneville, shelters our support battalion, the P. C. of the
advance battalion being at Montigny, still farther on.</p>

<p>The trenches are more varied and more interesting than
those in the Forest of Parroy. Those on the left of our
sector run along the front edge of the Bois Bouleaux, which
gives its occupants the shelter of trees, but leaves them in
a position to see an approaching enemy. The trenches to
the right run over open ground and finally straight across
the eastern tip of the town of Ancervillers, utilizing the
cellars, broken walls, etc. Machine gun nests have been
established in some of the cellars which dominate the open
spaces, the guns being raised to be able to fire at ground
level through carefully concealed concrete openings. The
1st battalion is in line, the 3rd in support, while the 2nd
is in “Camp Mud,” a group of barracks to the rear of us
in surroundings which provoke its title. Poor fellows, they
would much rather be in a battle.</p>


<h3>REHERREY</h3>


<p class="right"><em>April</em> 28th, 1918</p>


<p>Went over Saturday to St. Pol where Companies L and
M are in support positions and passed the night with Merle-Smith
and his Lieutenants, Carroll, Baker, Givens and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
Knowles. The village church is pretty badly wrecked, parts
of the walls and most of the roof being tumbled down in
crumbled ruins. One shell went through just in front of the
altar, but the roof above the altar is fairly well intact. I had
doubts as to whether I could use it for services, but Cornelius
Fitzpatrick and Frank Eustace offered to have it
cleaned up and put in shape for me by next morning. When
I arrived to say Mass I was delighted at the transformation
they had effected. The half ruined reredos of the altar was
a mass of bloom with big branches of blossoms which they
had cut from the fruit trees in the garden. It is one of the
pictures of the war that I shall long carry in my mind.</p>

<p>One of the men told me that Joyce Kilmer had been out
here on his duties as Sergeant of the Intelligence Section
to map out the ground with a view to its defence if attacked.
As his party was leaving the ruined walls he said,
“I never like to leave a church without saying a prayer,”
and they all knelt down among the broken fragments under
the empty vault and said a silent prayer—a beautiful
thought of a true poet and man of God.</p>


<h3>REHERREY</h3>


<p class="right"><em>May</em> 5th, 1918</p>


<p>Headquarters, both American and French, have been
very anxious for somebody to take prisoners, and we were
all very much pleased this morning to hear that a patrol
from Company D had gone out and bagged four of them.
Out across No Man’s Land from Ancervillers there is, or
used to be, a few houses which went by the name of Hameau
d’Ancervillers. There was some reason to believe
that a German outpost might be found there; so at midnight
last night a patrol of two officers and twenty-four
men, mainly from Company D, went on a little hunting expedition.
They crossed No Man’s Land to the old German
trenches, which they found to be battered flat.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Edmond J. Connelly remained with a few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
men in No Man’s Land to guard against surprise, and Lieutenant
Henry K. Cassidy took the rest of them, including
Sergeant John J. O’Leary of Company A, Sergeant Thomas
O’Malley of Company D and Sergeant John T. Kerrigan of
the Intelligence Section to examine the ruins of the hamlet.
Part of the wall of one house was left standing. O’Leary
led three men to one side of it, and O’Malley three others
to the other side, while Lieutenant Cassidy approached it
from the front. They were challenged by a German sentry
and the two Sergeants with their followers rushed at
once to close quarters and found themselves engaged with
six Germans, two of whom were killed, and one wounded,
the survivors dashing headlong into a dugout.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Cassidy, pistol in hand, ran to the opening
of the dugout and called on them to surrender. If any one
of them had any fight left in him we would have had to
mourn the loss of a brave young officer, but they surrendered
at discretion, and our whole party, with no casualties,
started back as fast as they could, carrying the wounded
prisoner and dragging the others with them. It was
an excellent job, done with neatness and dispatch. Valuable
papers were found on the wounded man and other information
was obtained at Division by questioning. The only
thing to spoil it was that two of our men, Corporal Joseph
Brown and Charles Knowlton got lost in the dark coming
in, and have not yet reported.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>


<h3>REHERREY</h3>


<p class="right"><em>May</em> 9th, 1918</p>


<p>War is a time of sudden changes and violent wrenches of
the heart strings; and we are getting a taste of it even before
we enter into the period of battles. We are to lose
Colonel Barker. Back in Washington they are looking for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
men who know the war game as it is played over here, and,
as Colonel Barker has been observing it, or engaged in it,
since the war began, they have ordered him back to report
for duty at the War Department.</p>

<p>Our regrets at his going are lessened by two considerations.
The first is that we feel he will get his stars by reason
of the change and it will make us glad for him and
proud for ourselves to see one of our Colonels made a
General. The other is the news that his successor is to be
Frank R. McCoy, of General Headquarters. He was not
a Colonel on the General Staff when we crossed his path
first, but Captain McCoy of the 3rd Cavalry, stationed at
Mission, Texas. I did not meet him down there, but heard
a whole lot about him—all good—from Colonel Haskell,
and from Colonel Gordon Johnston of the 12th New York,
who had been a captain with McCoy in the 3rd Cavalry.
About the time we got to Mission he was made Chief of
Staff to General Parker at Brownsville. Later I read of
his going to Mexico as military attaché with our new Ambassador,
Mr. Fletcher, and then that General Pershing had
reached out after him there to bring him over here with the
A. E. F. In the more remote past he has been Aide de
Camp to General Woods, Military Aide at the White House
under President Roosevelt, and on special duty for the
government on various semi-diplomatic missions. If this
list of employments had any tendency to make me wonder
how much of a soldier he was, it would have vanished
quickly after one look at his left breast which is adorned
with five service bars. They say in the army that McCoy
has done all kinds of duty that an officer can be called upon
to do, but has never missed a fight—a good omen for the
“Fighting Sixty-Ninth.”</p>

<p>He is a man of good height, of spare athletic figure,
with a lean strongly formed face, nose Roman and dominating,
brows capacious, eyes and mouth that can be humorous,
quizzical or stern, as I learned by watching him, in the first
five minutes. He has dignity of bearing, charm of manner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
and an alert and wide-ranging intelligence that embraces
men, books, art, nature. If he only thinks as well of us as
we are going to think of him I prophesy that he will have
this regiment in the hollow of his hand to do what he likes
with it. Everything helps. “<em>McCoy</em>, is it? Well, he has
a good name anyway,” said one of the “boys from home.”</p>

<p>Colonel McCoy came to us in the lines, the P. C. being
at Reherrey. The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">popotte</i> (mess) occupied two low-ceiled
rooms in a three-room cottage. We sat close together on
benches at a long plank table, but it was a jolly company.
To give the new Colonel a taste of his Regiment I told him
a monologue by one of our men that I had overheard the
evening before. There are a couple of benches right in
front of my billet, in the narrow space between the dung-heap
and the window, and there is always a lot of soldiers
around there in their free time. They know I am inside the
open window, but pay no attention to my presence—a real
compliment.</p>

<p>There was a military discussion on among the bunch
from Company C. They got talking about the German
policy of evacuating the front line trenches when we send
over a concentrated barrage preparatory to a raid, and then
letting fly at us with their machine guns as we return
empty-handed. Somebody said he thought it was a good
thing. This irritated my friend Barney Barry, solid Irishman,
good soldier, and I may add, a saintly-living man.
“But Oi don’t loike it,” he said, “Oi don’t loike it at all. It
looks too much loike rethreatin’,—I think they betther lave
us be. Take the foive uv us here—me and Jim Barry and
Pat Moran and Moike Cooney, and you Unger—you’re a
Dootchman, but you’re a good man—the foive of us in a
thrench with our roifles and what we’d have on us to shoot,
and a couple uv exthra bandoliers, and a bunch of thim
guinny foot-balls (hand grenades) and a bit of wire up in
front; and if the young officers u’d only keep their heads,
and not be sayin’ ‘Do this; and don’t do that’; gettin’ themselves
excoited, and whot’s worse, gettin’ us excoited, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
just lave us be, I give ye me wurrd that be the toime
mornin’ u’d come, and ye’d come to be buryin’ thim, ye’d
think ye had your old job back diggin’ the subway.”</p>

<p>The Colonel was delighted with this sample of the spirit
of his Irish regiment. And I determined to let him see the
whole works at once. He might as well get the full flavor
of the Regiment first as last. We had a concert going on
in the next room. Tom O’Kelly sang in his fine full rich
baritone the “Low Back Car” and that haunting Scottish
melody of “Loch Lomond.”</p>

<p>“Give us a rebel song, Tom,” I called. “What’s that,
sir—Father, I mean.” McCoy twinkled delightedly. “A
rebel song,” I repeated. “Alright, Father, what shall I
sing.” “Oh, you know a dozen of them. ‘The West’s
Awake,’ ‘O’Donnel Aboo’ or ‘A Nation Once Again.’”
Tom responded readily with “O’Donnel Aboo,” and as its
defiant strains ended in a burst of applause he broke into
the blood stirring old rebel ballad, “The Wearing of the
Green.” Colonel McCoy’s face was beaming. He evidently
likes things to have their proper atmosphere. I can
see the old Irish 69th is just what he expected it to be, and
what he wanted it to be. I see there is no worry in his
mind about how these singers of rebel songs will do their
part in this war.</p>

<p>I had a long talk with him today about the Regiment,
and I find him anxious to keep up its spirit and traditions.
They are as dear to him for their romantic flavor and
their military value as those of the Household Guards or
the Black Watch are to the Englishman or the Scot.</p>


<h3>REHERREY</h3>

<p class="right"><em>May</em> 12th, 1918</p>

<p>Majors Moynahan and Stacom are being transferred to
other duties, much to everybody’s regret. It looks like a
break up of the old Regiment. It would be, I fear, if anybody
but McCoy were Colonel. But he has a slate for promotion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
already; a 69th slate, and he will put it through if
anybody can—Anderson and James McKenna for Majors,
Prout and Bootz and W. McKenna for Captains. It will
save the spirit of the regiment if he can carry this through.
If the vacancies are filled by replacement we shall not know
ourselves in a short time. I feel all the more grateful to
our new Colonel because he had a share in planning the
replacement idea; and besides, I know that there are plenty
of officers at General Headquarters, friends of his, who
are anxious to get to the front and to have the 69th on their
service records. It would be an embarrassment to any other
man to go to G. H. Q. and ask them to change the scheme
of filling vacancies by replacement instead of by promotion.
But I know just what will happen, when they say
“Why, you helped to make this plan.” He will smile benignly,
triumphantly and say “That just proves my point.
Now that I am in command of a regiment I find by first
hand knowledge that the original plan does not work out
well.”</p>


<h3>DENEUVRE</h3>

<p class="right"><em>May</em> 15th, 1918</p>

<p>Our allotted three weeks in line being up, we returned
to our original stations, the only change being that the 2nd
Battalion comes to Deneuvre, while the 3rd has to go to
Camp Mud. I am billetted with the Curé, a devout and
amiable priest—who was carried off as a hostage by the
Germans in their retreat of 1914 and held by them for over
a year. He likes to have Americans around, and we fill
his house. Captain Anderson, Lieutenants Walsh, Howe,
Allen and Parker are domiciled with me. Joe Bruell and
Austin McSweeney have their wireless in a room in the
house, and draw down all sorts of interesting messages
from the other Sergeants. Sergeants McCarthy, Esler and
Russell are next door neighbors, and better neighbors no
man could choose. I can go down to the dooryard if time
hangs on my hands and hear remarks on men and things,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
made more piquant by New York slang or Irish brogue.</p>

<p>It is a delight to go to our mess with McCoy’s stimulating
wit and Lieutenant Colonel Mitchell’s homely philosophy
and Mangan’s lively comments, and the various aspects
of war and life opened up by all sorts of interesting
people—Bishops, diplomats, soldiers and correspondents
who drift in from afar, drawn by the magnetism of our
Colonel. The food may not always be to the taste of an
epicure but “we eat our Irish potatoes flavored with Attic
salt,” as Father Prout says.</p>

<p>But my chiefest joy in life is to have Joyce Kilmer
around. In the army it matters little whether a man was
a poet or a grave digger—he is going to be judged by what
he is as a soldier. And Joyce is rated high by everybody
from the K. P. to the Colonel because he is a genuine fellow.
He is very much a soldier—a Sergeant now, and
prouder of his triple chevron as member of the 69th than he
would be of a Colonel’s eagles in any other outfit. If they
do not let us commission officers within the Regiment he will
come out of the war as Sergeant Joyce Kilmer—a fine title,
I think, for any man, for it smacks of the battlefield with
no confounded taint of society about it. His life with us
is a very full and a very happy one. At first I selfishly took
him to help in my own duties regarding statistics. He
was glad to help, but he regretted leaving a line company,
and especially parting from a lot of friends he had made
among the Irish “boys from home,” whose simplicity
amused him and whose earnest faith aroused his enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Over here he got restless at being on the Adjutant’s force,
and when Lieutenant Elmer began his lectures on the work
and opportunities of the Intelligence Section—scouting, and
all the rest of it—Joyce pleaded with me to get him away
from a desk and out in the line. Now he is happy all the
day long. He has worked himself into various midnight
patrols, and Captain Anderson has told me to advise him
that he lacks caution in taking care of himself, but as Kilmer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
has told me the same thing about Anderson, I feel
helpless about them both.</p>

<p>I know Kilmer well. He has evidently made up his
mind to play the game without flinching, without any admixture
of fear. On our last day in Lunéville, when the
town was being shelled, I called to him to stand in a doorway
where there was a little less danger and he answered
with a story about Tom Lacey and a French Major, the
moral of which was that a soldier is expendable and officers
not; and the outcome of which was that I went forth and
walloped him till he came in, though still chuckling. He
has been for some time out on an observation post in a
beautiful spot which overlooks the German lines, with
Watson, Kerrigan, Beck, Mott, Levinson, Titterton—all
great admirers of his. Whenever he gets a day off he is
in to see me and we break all the rules chatting till midnight
and beyond. Books and fighting and anecdotes and
good fellows and things to eat and religion; all the good
old natural human interests are common to us, with a
flavor of literature, of what human-minded people have
said in the past to give them breadth and bottom.</p>

<p>Kilmer or I, or both of us, may see an end to life in this
war, but neither of us will be able to say that life has not
been good to us.</p>


<h3>DENEUVRE</h3>


<p class="right"><em>May</em> 17th, 1918</p>


<p>Just over to the Regimental Supply Office to see Mangan.
I am always looking for reasons to spend a while with
Captain Jack. He has a great outfit. I watched his trained
youngsters, Lacey, Kennedy, Burke, Nulty and the two
delightful Drennan boys at their business of taking care of
the Regiment, which they have learned to do so efficiently.
I wonder if they will find in civil life jobs to suit the talents
they display here. The Regimental Supply Sergeants,
Joe Flannery and Eddie Scanlon, could run anything. First
Sergeant Comiskey is back with us, and so is Harry Mallon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
mule-skinner and funmaker. Everybody was glad to
see Harry once more. Walter Lloyd’s gentle voice booming
from a nearby stable let me know that the Company
kitchen was near, so I wandered in that direction for a cup
of coffee from Healy and McAviney—always the height of
hospitality for everybody there. Stopped a row between
Frankie Meade and Carburetor Donnelly—Frankie is the
proud guardian of the Regimental ratter and the other boy-soldier
passed a remark about it that no man would let be
said about his dog. I held up Charlie Feick for a canteen,
and before I left Henry and Klauberg and Beverly had
dug me up an O. D. suit, underwear, socks, shoe-laces and
a web belt. Had a good day.</p>


<h3>BACCARAT</h3>


<p class="right"><em>May</em> 21st, 1918</p>


<p>The new regulations provide for a senior chaplain in each
Division. I felt that General Menoher would appoint me
for the job as I am senior in service, and I had a notion
that my friend Colonel MacArthur would suggest my name.
It has been a worry to me as I do not intend to leave the
regiment for anything else on earth and I am afraid I may
have to go through the war hanging around Division Headquarters.
So I asked Colonel McCoy if he would back me
in my refusal to accept the office if I had to quit the regiment,
to which I received a hearty affirmative.</p>

<p>I received news of the outcome from McCoy a few days
later. Colonel MacArthur had told him I was to be senior
chaplain, but he was in entire accord with my wish to remain
with a fighting unit. Our Chief of Staff chafes at his
own task of directing instead of fighting, and he has pushed
himself into raids and forays in which, some older heads
think, he had no business to be. His admirers say that his
personal boldness has a very valuable result in helping to
give confidence to the men. Colonel McCoy and Major
Donovan are strong on this point. Donovan says it would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
be a blamed good thing for the army if some General got
himself shot in the front line. General Menoher and General
Lenihan approve in secret of these madnesses; but all
five of them are wild Celts, whose opinion no sane man like
myself would uphold.</p>

<p>At any rate, Colonel McCoy was so satisfied with the
result of the outcome in my case that he went further and
said, “Now, if my chaplain is to be senior chaplain of the
Division it is not right that he should remain a First
Lieutenant. He ought to be a Major at least.” McCoy
told me with twinkling eyes, “MacArthur said, ‘Now, McCoy,
if I were you I would not bring up the question of
the rank of Father Duffy, for I had serious thoughts of
making him Colonel of the 165th instead of you.’ You are
a dangerous man, Father Duffy,” continued the genial McCoy,
“and I warn you, you won’t last long around here.”</p>


<h3>DENEUVRE</h3>


<p class="right"><em>May</em> 25th, 1918</p>


<p>Being made Senior Chaplain of the Division I judged
that my first, if not my sole duty, was to give a dinner to
the brethren. We had a meeting in the morning in a large
room under the Curé’s hospitable roof, and everyone was
there. Chaplains Halliday, Robb, Harrington, Smith and
McCallum I had known since our first days in Camp Mills,
and we had worked together ever since as if we belonged
to one religious family. Those who were added to our body
since we came to France impress us all as being first class
men. Three of them I call the “Young Highbrows”: Chaplains
N. B. Nash of the 150th F. A., who was a Professor
in the Episcopal Theological Seminary at Cambridge,
Charles L. O’Donnell, the poet priest of Notre Dame University,
who is attached to the 117th Engineers, and Eugene
Kenedy, who has been a professor in various Jesuit Colleges
and who is now working with the 150th Machine Gun
Battalion, after a month of breaking in with our regiment.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
Chaplain Ralph M. Tibbals, a Baptist Clergyman from the
Southwest, and Chaplain William Drennan, a priest from
Massachusetts, were new men to most of us, but made a decidedly
favorable impression.</p>

<p>We discussed a number of matters of common interest
and every single topic was decided by unanimous vote.
The clergy discover in circumstances like these that their
fundamental interests are absolutely in common. I do
not mean to say that there is any tendency to give up their
own special creeds; in fact, they all make an effort to supply
the special religious needs of men of various denominations
in their own regiments by getting the other chaplains
to have occasional services or by announcing such services
to the men. I told Bishop Brent that the way the Clergy of
different churches got along together in peace and harmony
in this Division would be a scandal to pious minds.</p>

<p>I think it would be a good thing if representatives of
various churches would have a meeting every year at the
seashore in bathing suits, where nobody could tell whether
the man he was talking to was a Benedictine Abbot, a
Methodist Sunday-School Superintendent or a Mormon Elder.
They would all find out how many things of interest
they have in common, and, without any disloyalty to their
own church, would get together to put them over.</p>

<p>At this meeting there was one thing that I wanted for
myself. Some day we shall have three Chaplains for each
Infantry regiment, but the time is long in coming, and I
am anxious to get someone to hold religious services for my
Protestant fellows. I have asked the Division Secretary
of the Y. M. C. A. to supply me with one of his Secretaries
who is a clergyman, to be attached permanently to the regiment;
promising that he would be treated as well as I myself.
I have been after this for a long while but the Division
Secretary has not too many men, and he is tied down
in the placing of them by the canteen situation which makes
it necessary to leave the same man in one place as long as
possible. Chaplains Nash and Halliday, who are very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
close to me in all my counsels, are going with me to Chaumont
to back me up in a request to the G. H. Q. Chaplains—Bishop
Brent, Chaplain Moody and Father Doherty,
to have them ask the chief officials of the Y. M. C. A. to
assign one of their Protestant clergyman permanently to
my regiment.</p>

<p>I had left the matter of dinner in the capable hands of
the Regimental Supply Sergeant, Joe Flannery, so everybody
went home satisfied.</p>

<p>During my stay at Deneuvre I have seen a good deal
of Bishop Brent, formerly Episcopal Bishop in the Philippines
and now Senior of the G. H. Q. Chaplains. He knew
Colonel McCoy in the Philippines, and like everybody who
ever knew him, is glad to have a chance to visit him. The
Bishop and I have become good friends, the only drawback
being that he talks too often about getting me with him at
G. H. Q., while my battle cry is that of every member of
the regiment, “I want to stick with my own outfit.” He
is anxious to have some first-hand experience of work in
the trenches and he has paid us the compliment of saying
that if he can get away he will attach himself to the 165th.
I hope he can come for I know that everybody will be as attached
to him as I am myself, and he on his part will have
some interesting experiences.</p>



<p class="right"><em>May</em> 26th, 1918</p>


<p>I have just been talking with Donovan, Anderson, Mangan
and others of the old timers and we all remarked on
what a hold Lieutenant Colonel Mitchell had gotten on us
during his short stay amongst us. He was assigned to us
as a replacement and drifted in so unassumingly that we
scarcely knew he had arrived until he was with us a week.
But as he has gone about from place to place doing all
kinds of jobs, —inspections, courtmartials, and the like, we
have grown to know him better, and to like him more the
more we know him. He is efficient without bustle, authoritative
without bluster, never unreasonable and full of quaint<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
native humor. His father was a Chaplain in the Army
which is perhaps one of the reasons why the son and I are
already like old chums.</p>


<h3>BACCARAT</h3>


<p class="right"><em>May</em> 30th, 1918</p>


<p>The uniforms we wear as well as the losses we have
already sustained make us appreciate the significance of Memorial
Day. General Menoher left the arrangements for
a proper celebration of the day to the Chaplains. So I called
a meeting at which all were present. It was an easy matter
to select speakers from our various commands to address
meetings of soldiers in every village in which elements of
the Division were quartered. The regimental bands of the
Infantry and Artillery Regiments were to be sent by trucks
from one station to another, so that all of our soldiers
should have the benefit of their services.</p>

<p>The main celebration was to be at Baccarat where our
Division Headquarters were, and the burden of arranging
for it fell on the 165th, now in reserve. The dead of our
Division, mainly men of the 84th Brigade, which has been
in this Sector since the beginning of March, are buried in
a Military Cemetery; and our first duty was to pay them
solemn honors. Polychrom of Company A made wreaths
from the flowers lavishly offered by the people of Deneuvre.
Everybody of all ranks who could be spared was present
at the ceremony, together with large number of the civilian
population. Children of the town were selected to place
the wreaths upon the graves of our dead, and the last resting
place of our French companions was not neglected.</p>

<p>After the ceremony Captain Handy came to me with an
invitation from General Menoher to ride back with him.
General Menoher is a man who begets loyalty and confidence.
Americans are better acquainted with the business
type of man than the military type, and I think I can best
characterize him by saying that if he were out of uniform<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
he would impress one as a successful business man—one
of the kind that can carry responsibility, give orders affecting
large affairs with calmness and certainty, and still
find time to be human. He is entirely devoid of posing, of
vanity, or of jealousy. His only desire is to see results.
Consequently his subordinates are doing magnificent teamwork,
and the excellent condition of the Division is due
to this factor as well as his direct care of us. We are exceedingly
fortunate in having such a man to rule over us.</p>

<p>Colonel McCoy saw to it that the grave of every one of
our dead was properly honored on this day—in Southampton,
in Langres, in Ancervillers and here in Baccarat.
During the afternoon he and I went to Croix-Mare; so likewise
did General Menoher with Colonel MacArthur and
General Lenihan with Major Conway. We found that the
Curé and his parishioners, as also the French soldiers, had
kept the graves there in beautiful condition—a tribute to
our dead which warms our heart to the people of France.</p>


<h3>LETTER TO A CURATE</h3>


<p class="right"><em>June</em> 10th, 1918</p>


<p>In spite of all you tell me I have lost, I have a stray assortment
of arms and legs left, ungainly, I admit, but still
serviceable, whether for reaching for the bread at messtime
or for pushing me around my broad parish. I hear that I
am dead—wounded—gone crazy. I hate to contradict so
many good people, but I must say that I know I am alive,
and that I never felt better in my life. As for the third
count, perhaps I had better leave it to others to testify, but
I’m no worse than I always was. I may be considered a
bit off for coming over here, but that’s a decent kind of
craziness, and one I am glad to see becoming quite popular.</p>

<p>I wish that my case could serve as a warning to good
folks at home who are distracted by all sorts of rumors
about their lads here. If anything happens to any one of
us, the folks will hear of it from Washington within a hundred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
hours. If it says “Slightly Wounded,” they may take
it as good news. For let me tell you, if I was worrying
continually about the fate of some dear one over here, and
got word he was “Slightly Wounded,” I would sigh a sigh
of relief that the beloved was out of harm’s way and having
a good time for a while.</p>

<p>I don’t mind rumors in the army. They are part of the
game. With eating and growling, they constitute our chief
forms of recreation. Fact is, I am made the father of most
of them in this regiment. When some lad starts his tongue
going, and everybody tells him just what kind of a liar he
is, he says that Father Duffy said so, and Father Duffy
got it straight from Secretary Baker or General Pershing,
or, who knows?—by revelation. It is a great compliment
to me, but a left-handed one to my teaching.</p>

<p>At home, though, rumors don’t just interest—they hurt.
I know how much they hurt, for my pile of “agony letters”
keeps mounting up with every mail. And I can’t answer
them all at length, as I would wish—not if I want to do
anything else.</p>

<p>First-class mail is the bane of my life as Chaplain. Like
everyone else, I don’t mind reading it, but I know what it
means when it comes to answering it. Gosh! how I hate
that. I like to keep on the go. I have to keep on the go to
get anything done, with the regiment scattered in five different
villages, miles apart, and outside work to do in the
other outfits for men that want the sacraments, and hospitals
to visit. And to have to stick a whole day at a table to
soothe sorrows that don’t exist, or oughtn’t to—whew!</p>

<p>The letters I am most ready to answer are from those
who have gotten real bad news from Washington. God be
good to them. I’d do anything for them. And the ones I
am glad to get—if I don’t have to answer them myself—are
those that put me onto something I can do for the men—see
that Jimmy keeps the pledge, or that Tom goes to
Church, or find what’s the matter with Eddie who lost his
stripes, or break bad news to Michael, or see that Jack<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
doesn’t fall in love with any of those French hussies, but
comes back to the girl that adores him. These all help, and
I get round to them in time—and make the victim write a
letter, to which I put my name as censor—a proof of my
efforts.</p>

<p>But the biggest bulk of my mail consists of inquiries why
no mail has arrived from Patrick for three weeks—and is
he dead—or why Jerry’s allotment had not been made.
When I interview Patrick, he informs me disgustedly
that he has written home every twenty minutes. And I
know that before any letter of mine can get there, the Sullivans
will have received a bunch of mail that will make
them the gossips and the envy and the pride of the parish
till they begin to get worried and write to me again.</p>

<p>As for the allotments, the nearest I come—don’t ask me
how near—to falling into the sole vice of our army of using
strong language is when I get a letter from some poor
mother or wife about their non-payment. Our men have
been extraordinarily decent about helping out the folks at
home. But it has been new forms to make out, or the demand
for a change of the name of Mrs. Michael J. Farrell
to Mrs. Mary Farrell—and all the time decent folks going
short at home, and the best men we’ve got fretting in the
trenches. That’s the way these fountain-pen soldiers are
helping to win the war. How have they kept it so secret?
Even men like those that make up our Board of Trustees
have written me that our men are slack about making allotments.
And the poor fellows in most cases have stripped
themselves to ten dollars a month, and are scudding along
on bare poles half way between paydays—I know all about
that, and the Trustees, all good men and true, will hold back
<em>their</em> language when I report that I had to use their money
for lads that had left themselves destitute for their folks,
while their folks were being left destitute by those people
in Washington.</p>

<p>You ask me to tell you about my work here. Well, in
the main it is what I did at home, though under different<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
circumstances. The old Sixty-Ninth is a parish—an itinerant
parish. Probably a sixth of the “parishioners” do not
look to me for dogmatic instruction, but you know how
much that counts for in my ordinary relations with them.
Remember the afternoon last Spring, when Father Prunty
went into the play-hall to get helpers from my gang for his
patriotic gardening and found afterward that his five volunteers
consisted of two Protestants, two Jews and Andy
O’Hare.</p>

<p>I have this class of parishioners very much on my conscience.
I can’t get the other chaplains to help except on
the few occasions when regiments, or parts of them occupy
the same place. Every chaplain has five times what he can
do to supply Sunday services for his own scattered command.</p>

<p>At any rate, I can assure you that the different elements
in the old regiment have fused properly. By the way, I
cannot remember anything that delighted me more than
when I heard Sergeant Abe Blaustein was to get the Croix
de Guerre—he was recommended for it by Major Donovan
and Major Stacom (the pride of our parish) and Lieutenant
Cavanaugh. He is a good man, Abe, and the 69th appreciates
a good man when it sees him. John O’Keefe’s poem
made a hit with all of us.</p>

<p>That reminds me of something at my expense. Captain
John Prout approached me with a genial grin to tell me
that at our Christmas Mass he had seen a Jew boy present,
and later on he asked him “What were you doing at
Mass?” “Oh, Captain,” he said, “you know I’d go to Hell
with you.” Prout said to me, “The compliment to myself
is very obvious, Father,—I hope that you will be able to
find in it one for yourself too.”</p>

<p>But I started to tell you about my work. I have a congregation
of the old faith, approximately three thousand
souls. They are generally scattered through five or six
French villages, when <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en repos</i>, and more scattered still
through trenches and abandoned towns when in line.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span></p>

<p>To begin with the form of pastoral activity you are no
doubt most interested in, for you will be getting a parish
one of these days—I take up no collections. ’Tis a sad confession
to make, and I expect to be put out of the Pastor’s
Union when I get back for breach of rules. But the lads
are not left entirely without proper training. The old
French curés (God bless them, they are a fine lot of old
gentlemen) take up the collection. A tremendously important-looking
old beadle in a Napoleonic cocked hat and
with a long staff goes before, with a money-or-your-life
air about him, and in the rear comes the apologetic mannered
curé, or perhaps a little girl, carrying a little dish that
is a stimulus to stinginess, which is timidly pushed forward
a few inches in the direction of the man on the outside
seat. If the man is an American he grabs the dish and
sticks it under the nose of his neighbor, with a gruff whisper,
“Cough up.” They cough up all right—if it isn’t too
far from payday. Even at that they are good for more of
the Cigar Store coupons and the copper washers that pass
for money here than are the local worshippers. The curés
proclaim us the most generous people in the world—and so
we are—which makes it unanimous. They listen with open
mouths to my tales of financial returns in city parishes at
home and wish secretly that they had started life where
things are run like that—until I tell them of the debts we
have to carry, and they are content once more that their
lot has been cast in the quiet, old-time villages of Lorraine.</p>

<p>But to do them justice, they are most impressed by the
way our men practice their religion. Two companies of our
regiment jam a village church—aisles, sanctuary, sacristy,
porch. A battalion shows its good will by filling the churchyard,
the windows being ornamented by rough martial visages
which don’t look exactly like those of the placid looking
saints in the stained glass above—but I feel that the saints
were once flesh-and-blood people themselves, and that they
have an indulgent, perhaps even an admiring eye, on the
good lads that are worshipping God as best they can.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span></p>

<p>There is no doubt anyway about the opinion of the good
priests who are carrying on the work of the dead and gone
saints. They are full of enthusiasm about our fellows.
What attracts them most is their absolute indifference to
what people are thinking of them as they follow their religious
practices. These men of yours, they tell me, are
not making a show of religion; they are not offending others;
they touch their hats to a church, or make the sign of
the Cross, or go to Mass just because they want to, with
the same coolness that a man might show in taking coffee
without milk or expressing a preference for a job in life.
They run bases with scapulars flying, and it don’t occur to
them that they have scapulars on, any more than they would
be conscious of having a button of their best girl or President
Wilson pinned to their shirts—they may have all three.</p>

<p>Come to think of it, it is a tribute not only to our religious
spirit, but to the American spirit as a whole. The
other fellows don’t think of it either—no more than I do
that one of our Chaplains who is closest to me in every
thought and plan wears a Masonic ring. We never advert
to it except when some French people comment on our traveling
together—and then it is a source of fun.</p>

<p>I often drop in on soldiers of other outfits around their
kitchens or in the trenches, or during a halt on the road,
and hear confessions. Occasionally Catholic soldiers in
country regiments, with the small-town spirit of being loth
to doing anything unusual while people are looking at them,
hold back. Then my plan is to enlist the co-operation of the
Protestant fellows, who are always glad to pick them out
for me and put them in my clutches. They have a lot of
sport about it, dragging them up to me as if they were prisoners;
but it is a question of serious religion as soon as
their confession begins, the main purpose of the preliminaries
being simply to overcome a country boy’s embarrassment.
It proves, too, that the average American likes to see
a man practice his religion, whatever it may be.</p>

<p>With my own men there is never any difficulty of that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
kind. I never hear confessions in a church, but always in
the public square of a village, with the bustle of army life
and traffic going on around us. There is always a line of
fifty or sixty soldiers, continuously renewed throughout the
afternoon, until I have heard perhaps as many as five hundred
confessions in the battalion. The operation always
arouses the curiosity of the French people. They see the
line of soldiers with man after man stepping forward, doffing
his cap with his left hand, and making a rapid sign of
the cross with his right, and standing for a brief period
within the compass of my right arm, and then stepping forward
and standing in the square in meditative posture while
he says his penance. “What are those soldiers doing?” I
can see them whispering. “They are making the Sign of the
Cross. Mon Dieu! they are confessing themselves.” Non-Catholics
also frequently fall into line, not of course to
make their confession, but to get a private word of religious
comfort and to share in the happiness they see in the faces
of the others.</p>

<p>Officers who are not Catholics are always anxious to provide
opportunities for their men to go to confession; not
only through anxiety to help them practice their religion,
but also for its distinct military value. Captain Merle-Smith
told me that when I was hearing confessions before
we took over our first trenches he heard different of his men
saying to his first sergeant, Eugene Gannon, “You can put
my name down for any kind of a job out there. I’m all
cleaned up and I don’t give a damn what happens now.”</p>

<p>That is the only spirit to have going into battle—to be
without any worries for body or soul. If battles are to be
won, men have to be killed; and they must be ready, even
willing, to be killed for the cause and the country they are
fighting for. While we were still in Lunéville the regiment
attended Mass in a body and I said to them, “Much as I
love you all I would rather that you and I myself, that
all of us should sleep our last sleep under the soil of France
than that the historic colors of this Old Regiment, the banner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
of our republic, should be soiled by irresolution or disgraced
by panic.”</p>

<p>The religion of the Irish has characteristics of its own—they
make the Sign of the Cross with the right hand, while
holding the left ready to give a jab to anybody who needs it
for his own or the general good. I cannot say that it is an
ideally perfect type of Christianity; but considering the sort
of world we have to live in yet, it as near as we can come at
present to perfection for the generality of men. It was into
the mouth of an Irish soldier that Kipling put the motto,
“Help a woman, and hit a man; and you won’t go far
wrong either way.”</p>


<h3>BACCARAT</h3>


<p class="right"><em>May</em>, 1918</p>


<p>The Knights of Columbus have secured a splendid place
in Baccarat. The Curé had a large hall with extra rooms
and a nice yard outside, for the young men of the Parish;
and this he was glad to hand over to the K. of C. for the
use of American soldiers. Early in the game Mr. Walter
Kernan had tried to get in touch with me but had failed
as we were moving around too much. However, he had
sent me a check for 5,000 francs with instructions to use it
for the men. I had no need of money, as our Board of
Trustees were willing to supply whatever I should ask, and
there were very few things that could be purchased on the
scale demanded by a regiment of 3,600 men. We have now
received the services of Messrs. Bundschuh, May and Mr.
Kernan’s brother, Joseph, with a French-American priest
whom I assigned to look after the Catholics in two of the
artillery regiments.</p>

<p>We opened the building with solemn pomp and ceremony
in the presence of representatives of Division Headquarters,
M. Michaud, the Mayor of the City, Colonel McCoy and
many of the Chaplains and a large throng of officers and
men. With this commodious building in addition to the
quarters of the “Y” the matter of recreation for men in
town will be well looked after.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span></p>


<h3>CHASSEURS</h3>


<p class="right"><em>June</em> 10th, 1918</p>


<p>Our Division has taken over a new sector from the
French just to the right of our line bordering on the sector
occupied by the Iowas and it is at present occupied by Major
Donovan with Companies A and B of his battalion. It has a
picturesque name, “The Hunter’s Meeting Place—Rendezvouz
des Chasseurs,” and is even more picturesque than
its name. There is a high hog-back of land jutting out towards
the German line between deep thickly-wooded valleys.
When this was a quiet sector the French soldiers in their
idle time put a great deal of labor on it to make it comfortable
and attractive, and when I came out here a few
days ago I could easily have believed it if told there was
no such a thing as war, and that this whole place had been
designed as a rustic semi-military playground for the younger
elements on some gentleman’s country estate. The officers’
dugouts are against the side of the steeply sloping
hill so that only the inner portion is really under ground,
windows and doors on one side opening on terraces which
have flower beds, strawberry plots, and devices made of
whitewashed stones.</p>

<p>We dine <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">al fresco</i> under the trees. An electric light plant
is installed and I spent last night on the Major’s bunk indulging
an old habit of reading late. Donovan, like McCoy,
always has some books with him no matter where he goes;
and I got hold of a French translation of “Cæsar’s Commentaries,”
with notes by Napoleon Bonaparte.</p>

<p>I enjoy being with Donovan. He is so many-sided in
his interests, and so alert-minded in every direction, and
such a gracious attractive fellow besides, that there is never
a dull moment with him. His two lieutenants, Ames and
Weller, are of similar type; and as both are utterly devoted
to him, it is a happy family. Ames takes me aside periodically
to tell me in his boyish, earnest way that I am the only
man who can boss the Major into taking care of himself,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
and that I must tell him that he is doing entirely too much
work and taking too great risks, and must mend his evil
ways. I always deliver the message, though it never does
any good. Just now I am not anxious for Donovan to
spare himself, for I know that he has been sent here because,
in spite of its sylvan attractiveness, this place is a post
of danger, so situated that the enemy could cut it off from
reinforcements, and bag our two companies unless the strictest
precautions are kept up.</p>

<p>Major Allen Potts, a genial and gallant Virginian, who
is now in charge of the military police, has obtained permission
to bring up one company of his M. P.’s to help our
fellows hold the line. It is a good idea. The M. P. have
a mean job as they have to arrest other soldiers for breach
of regulations; and they are exposed to resentful retorts of
the kind, “Where’s your coat?” “Where you’ll never go to
look for it—out in No Man’s Land.” Nobody can talk that
way to Major Potts’s outfit.</p>

<p>There was a gas attack last night on the French sector
called Chapellotte on the edge of the bluff to our immediate
right, and Donovan and I went over this morning to see
the extent of the damage. As we climbed the steep hill
to reach the French positions we met Matthew Rice of Company
A, who was in liaison with the French; and he told us
in the coolest way in the world a story of a sudden gas attack
in the middle of the night, which put out of action
nearly two hundred men, leaving himself and four or five
Frenchmen the only surviving defenders of the hill. If the
same thing were to happen at Chasseurs the Germans could
easily follow it up and capture the whole outfit; and I can
see the reason for Major Donovan’s ceaseless precautions.</p>


<h3>BACCARAT</h3>


<p class="right"><em>June</em> 15th, 1918</p>


<p>My principal occupation these days is visiting the hospitals,
of which there are three in Baccarat. The Spanish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
Influenza has hit the Division and a large number of the
men are sick. The fever itself is not a terrible scourge, but
when pneumonia follows it, it is of a particularly virulent
type. Our deaths, however, have been few: John F. Donahoe
of Company F, Richard J. Hartigan of Company I,
Fred Griswold of Machine Gun Company and Patrick A.
Hearn of Company D, whose death had a particular pathos
by reason of the sorrow of his twin brother who is in the
same Company. All in all, we have been a singularly healthy
regiment, whatever be the reason—some doctors think it is
because we are a city regiment. We have been almost absolutely
free from the “Children’s Diseases” such as mumps,
measles, scarlet fever, diphtheria, etc., which have played
havoc with the efficiency strength of almost every other regiment
in the Division. Occasionally replacements introduce
some of those diseases, but they have never made any headway.
Since we left home our full total of deaths in a Regiment
of thirty-six hundred men has been, outside of battle
cases, just fourteen. John L. Branigan, of Company B,
died in an English hospital. In the Langres area we lost
Charles C. Irons, Company G; Edward O’Brien, Company
M, and James Reed, Company E, by illness, and Sydney
Cowley, Company G, by accidental shooting. Accidents
were also the causes of the deaths of Corporal Winthrop
Rodewald, Company H, Donald Monroe, Company F, and
Daniel J. Scanlon of Company G, who also left a brother
in the Company to mourn his loss. Louis King and Joseph
P. Morris of Company I and George W. Scallon of Company
A died of meningitis.</p>

<p>In this sector we have had just three battle losses. When
Company G was in line, a direct hit of a German shell killed
two of our old-timers, Patrick Farrell and Timothy Donnellan,
and wounded Peter Bohan. Recently at Chasseurs, Corporal
Arthur Baker, a resolute soldier, was killed while
leading a daylight patrol in No Man’s Land. Sergeant
Denis Downing of Company G was killed by one of our own
sentries who mistook him for a German.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span></p>


<h3>BACCARAT</h3>


<p class="right"><em>June</em> 16th, 1918</p>


<p>Donovan’s men have been recalled from Chasseurs. The
42nd Division has finished its preliminary education and is
to start off for some more active front two days from
now. We are to be relieved by the 77th Division, New
York City’s contribution to the National Army. Today
while returning from a funeral I met two M. P.’s from that
Division who were members of the Police Force at home.
Met also two old pupils of mine, Father James Halligan
and Lieutenant Arthur McKeogh.</p>


<h3>MOYEMONT</h3>


<p class="right"><em>June</em> 19th, 1918</p>


<p>Yesterday was New York “Old Home Day” on the roads
of Lorraine. We marched out from Baccarat on our hunt
for new trouble, and met on the way the 77th Division, all
National Army troops from New York City. It was a
wonderful encounter. As the two columns passed each
other on the road in the bright moonlight there were songs
of New York, friendly greetings and badinage, sometimes
good humored, sometimes with a sting in it. “We’re going
up to finish the job that you fellows couldn’t do.” “Look
out for the Heinies or you’ll all be eating sauerkraut in a
prison camp before the month is out.” “The Germans will
find out what American soldiers are like when we get a
crack at them.” “What are you givin’ us,” shouted Mike
Donaldson; “we was over here killin’ Dutchmen before
they pulled your names out of the hat.” “Well, thank
God,” came the response, “we didn’t have to get drunk to
join the army.”</p>

<p>More often it would be somebody going along the lines
shouting “Anybody there from Greenwich Village?” or
“Any of you guys from Tremont?” And no matter what
part of New York City was chosen the answer was almost
sure to be “Yes.” Sometimes a chap went the whole line<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
calling for some one man: “Is John Kelly there?” the
answer from our side being invariably, “Which of them
do you want?” One young fellow in the 77th kept calling
for his brother who was with us. Finally he found him
and the two lads ran at each other burdened with their
heavy packs, grabbed each other awkwardly and just
punched each other and swore for lack of other words until
officers ordered them into ranks, and they parted perhaps
not to meet again. At intervals both columns would
break into song, the favorites being on the order of</p>

<h3>MORIVILLE</h3>


<p class="right"><em>June</em> 22nd, 1918</p>


<p>Our first day’s march brought us to Moyemont, our second
a short hike to Moriville, where we are waiting to entrain
at Châtel-sur-Moselle. I am billetted with the Curé
and have sent Father McDonald, an old pupil of mine who
has just been sent to me, to the 2nd Battalion. He is not
well enough to stand what we will have to go through, so
I have sent a telegram to Bishop Brent asking to have him
kept for a time at some duty where he can regain his health.</p>

<p>Now I have to turn my attention to the Curé, who is
also an invalid. He is living here in this big, bleak stone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
house, with an old housekeeper who is deaf, and the biggest,
ugliest looking brute of a dog I have ever seen. He
is run down and dispirited. We Americans don’t like that
atmosphere so I started in to chirk him up. First I called
in Dr. Lyttle, who pronounced the verdict that there was
no reason why with rest and change and a new outlook on
life he could not last for ten years.</p>

<p>Today is Sunday and I told the lads in church that I
wanted a collection to give a poor old priest a holiday; and
they responded nobly. For a second Mass I went down
to McKenna’s town and found a new device, a green shamrock
on a white background, over the door of his battalion
headquarters. His is to be known as the Shamrock battalion
of the regiment. After Mass and another collection
I took breakfast with him. I had brought with me some
money that Captain Mangan owed him. While I was at
breakfast Mangan came in himself, and in his presence I
handed the money over to McKenna. “If I didn’t have
you around, Father, to threaten Mangan with hell-fire, I’d
never get a cent of it.” “If you weren’t such a piker you
wouldn’t keep a cent of it, now you’ve got it. You’d give
it to Father Duffy for his poor old Curé.” “All right, I’ll
give it, and double it if you cover it.” That meant forty
dollars apiece for my nice old gentlemen. But McKenna
was not satisfied. “Come on, Cassidy, come across,” and
the Lieutenant with a smile on his handsome face came
across with more than any Lieutenant can afford. McKenna
shouted to the others, “Come all the rest of you
heretics; you haven’t given a cent to a church since you
left home,” and with a whole lot of fun about it, everybody
gave generously. I could not help thinking what a
lesson in American broadmindedness the whole scene presented.
But the immediate point was that I was able to do
handsomely for my old Curé. I went back to him, and
from the different collections I poured into his hat in copper
pennies, bits of silver, dirty little shin-plasters and
ten franc notes, the sum of two thousand francs. He was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
speechless. The old housekeeper wept; even the dog barked
its loudest.</p>

<p>“I’m giving you this with one condition,” I said.
“Namely, that you spend it all at once.” “But ma foi!
how can one spend two thousand francs in a short while.
I never had so much money before in all my life.” “Of
course you can’t spent it in this burg. I want you to go
away to Vittel, to Nancy, to Paris, anywhere, and give
yourself a good time for once in your life.” “But the
Bishop would never permit it. He has few priests left and
cannot supply the parishes with them.” “Well, he will
have to do it if you’re dead, and you’ll be dead soon if
you hang around here. Stay in bed next Sunday and have
your parishioners send in complaints to the Bishop. Do
that again the Sunday after, and by that time the Bishop
will have to send somebody. Then you go off and spend
that 2,000 francs on a summer holiday, and don’t come
back until you have spent the last cent of it.”</p>

<p>The old gentleman gave a dazed assent to my entire
scheme; but I am leaving here with little expectation that he
will carry it all through. He may get a holiday from the
Bishop, and he may spend a little of the money on it, but
even if he lives for ten years I am willing to bet he will
have some of our 2,000 francs left when he dies. In some
ways it is a great handicap to be French.</p>


<h3>BREUVERY</h3>


<p class="right"><em>June</em> 27th, 1918</p>


<p>On June 23rd we boarded the now familiar troop trains
at Châte-sur-Moselle, and before we were off them we had
zig-zagged our way more than half the distance to Paris,
going up as far as Nancy, down to Neufchateau, northwest
again by Bar-le-Duc, finally detraining on June 24th,
at Coolus, south of Chalons-sur-Marne. We are now in
five villages along the River Coole. We have left Lorraine
at last and are in the province of Champagne. It is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
a different kind of country. The land is more level and
less heavily wooded; the houses are built of a white, chalky
stone with gray tiles instead of red; and with outbuildings
in the rear of them—with the result (for which heaven be
praised) that the dung heaps are off the streets. The inhabitants
strike us as being livelier and less worried, whether
from natural temperament or distance from the battle
line, I do not know. The weather is beautiful and it is
the joy of life to walk along the shaded roads that border
the sleepy Coole and drop in on a pleasant company at
mess time to share in their liveliness and good cheer. Today
it was a trip to St. Quentin with the Machine Gun
Company. Johnnie Webb and Barnett picked me up on the
road and formed my escort, leading me straight to the
kitchen, where Sergeant Ketchum and Mike Clyne were
making ready for the return of the hungry gunners. Lieutenant
De Lacour wanted me to go to Captain Seibert’s
mess but I preferred by lunch on the grass with Milton
Cohen, John Kenny, Ledwith, McKelvey, Murphy, Chester
Taylor and Pat Shea. This is the kind of a war I like.</p>

THE CHAMPAGNE DEFENSIVE</h2>
</div>

<h3>VADENAY FARM, CAMP DE CHALONS</h3>

<p class="right"><em>July</em> 2nd, 1918</p>

<p>I like this spot, but it was a terrible place to get to.
We got hurry-up orders to leave our pleasant villages on
the Coole on June 26th. It was payday and some of the
fellows had hiked it into Chalons and back to find something
to spend their money on. But it was “pack your
kits and trek” for everybody.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful soft June night. No moon, but the
French highway rolled out before us dull white in the
gloom, as if its dust were mingled with phosphorus. The
men trudged along behind—joking and singing—it was the
beginning of the march. After a couple of hours we entered
Chalons, a dream city by night. Not a light was
visible, but the chalk stone buildings showed dimly on
either hand, and the old Cathedral, with the ravages of
the French Revolution obscured by darkness, was more
beautiful than in the day. But before we left that town
behind, all the poetry had departed from it. It seemed to
take hours and hours of hard hiking on uneven pavements
before the wearying men found their feet on country roads
once more. Nobody knew how far the column had to go,
and every spire that marked a village was hailed with hope,
and, I fear, cursed when the hope was unrealized. They
had a weary night ahead before they reached their destinations.
The headquarters found itself with Division Headquarters
in the Ferme de Vadenay, which is not a farm at
all, but some long low barracks on the Camp de Chalons.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
The nearest approach to a farmer I saw there was a French
soldier, who carefully nursed a few cabbages to feed his
rabbits. He was a Breton fisherman, who had gone to the
war, and the war had touched his wits. As a younger
man he had fished in the North Sea and was the only person
I ever found who could confirm the existence of Captain
George MacAdie’s native town of Wyck. It was a great
triumph for George, for my geographical skepticism had
aroused a doubt as to whether he had ever been born at
all.</p>

<p>The Chalons plains set all of us old Border veterans going
again. The first comment was “Just like Texas.” A
broad expanse of flat brookless country with patches of
scrimpy trees that surely must be mesquite. But I delight
in it. There is a blue sky over it all, and the long reaches
for the eye to travel are as fascinating and as restful as
the ocean. In Texas the attraction is in the skies. Half of
it is beautiful. The half you see by gazing at the horizon
and letting the eye travel up and back till it meets the horizon
again. But here the flat earth has beauties of its own.
It is God’s flower garden. The whole ground is covered
with wild flowers—marguerites and bluets by millions
and big clumps of violets as gorgeous as a sanctuary of
Monsignori, and poppies, poppies everywhere. Colonel McCoy
gave me a copy of Alan’s Seegar’s poems with one
marked Champagne, 1915. Two lines of it are running
through my head all day.</p>

<p>Champagne. The word is a familiar one with other associations.
We had thought that the bottles grew on trees
and that the thirsty traveler had but to detach the wire that
held them. And behold it is a land as dry as Nebraska.
There are no such vivifying trees, nor lowly vines, nor
even abundant water. A vastly over-advertised country in
the opinion of the present collection of tourists.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span></p>


<h3>BOIS DE LA LYRE</h3>


<p class="right"><em>July</em> 7th, 1918</p>


<p>Bois de la Lyre—Harp Woods since the 69th got here.
We have arrived in two stages. We were to celebrate the
4th of July in proper fashion with games and feasting.
But there was not much with which to hold high revelry,
and the games were practically spoiled by an order to move.
Anyway, our minds are on other things. I came on Terry
O’Connor, sitting with his shirt open on account of the heat,
busily cleaning his rifle. “Man dear,” I said, “Where is
your patriotism? Every man home has a flag in his button-hole.
I’m ashamed of you.” “I’ve got me roifle” (patting
it) “an’ me Scafflers” (pointing to the brown string showing
on his bared neck); “what more does a pathriot need?”</p>

<p>We moved by night, as usual, but not far, to the École
Normale de Tir. The Normal School sounded big and fine.
One expected a square two-story red brick building with
white sandstone trimmings—but we found a collection of
half underground iron covered dugouts, and all overground
rough little board shacks. We would be happy there now
for we find that this poetically named spot is some degrees
less attractive. It looks as if somebody had put it up in a
hurry because the cattle were out in bad weather. The
Officers are in the sheds, the men out in what they call
the Bois—which are probably thick enough for concealment
from an inquisitive aeroplane. But that is all we need
while this blessed weather holds. Sunny France had ceased
to be the joke it was.</p>

<p>And then, something seems to be doing at last. We
who are in the know have been hearing tales of plans
afoot—an attack on the Chateau Thierry salient at Chatillon-sur-Marne
seemed to be the plan when we first reached
these parts. The indications are now that the Germans
are due for another inning and we are to meet them here.
Anderson has gone up with the 2nd Battalion to hold the
trenches with the French. Donovan and McKenna are in
support. There is a big dugout in a knoll ahead of us—they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
call it a hill, just as in Atlantic City any place four
feet above tide water is called a height—and we are to move
there when action begins. I am sitting on top of it—have
been here all this sunny afternoon reading a book the
Colonel gave me, Gabriel Hanotaux on France under
Henri Quatre—and I certainly do not like the idea of
spending my young life in a dugout P. C. during action. I
am going to tell Colonel McCoy that my spiritual duties
demand that I visit Anderson’s Battalion. He says that
he wants his Officers to enjoy this war—the only war most
of them can hope to have. And I hate dugouts anyway.</p>

<p>To get from Harp Woods to Chapel Woods you go
north for about four miles through Jonchery to St. Hilaire
le Grand—a bit of a village which to borrow from Voltaire’s
remark about the Holy Roman Empire does not look
particularly saintly nor hilarious nor grand. The Ohios
are on the right of it, and our Company E just to the
west with patches of blue Frenchmen dotted all around.
Follow the Ancient Roman Way for a kilometer or two
and you get to a patch of woods with tops of mounds
showing through them as if large sized moles had been
working there. It is marked on the map as Subsector
Taupinière in the Auberive sector. But we carry our
names with us, and these bits of the soil of France are to
be called while we inhabit them P. C. Anderson, P. C.
Kelly, P. C. Prout and P. C. Finny; P.C., meaning “Post of
Command.”</p>

<p>I have spent the week with Anderson. He has his P. C. in
an elephant hut—a little hole about five feet underground
with a semi-circular roof of corrugated iron piled over with
sand bags and earth,—enough to turn the splinters of a shell.
I passed a couple of days with Captain Charles Baker of
Company E, who is over to the right, along the Suippes.
Charles is all energy and business, as usual. And Lieutenant
Andy Ellett came in one night quite peevish because the
French had countermanded the orders for a patrol. Andy
likes the scent of danger. At P. C. Baker I saw Jim Murray,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
whom I once started out for the priesthood. I spent a pleasant
day wandering about on my lawful occasions among the
men in the different positions, one of which I found very
popular, as just there the Suippes had actually enough water
for a man to take a decent bath in. At the proper time I did
not fail to discover the Company Kitchen, located on the
river bank in a charming spot. While doing justice to a
good meal I discussed Mt. Vernon politics with Carmody
and Vahey.</p>

<p>The battalion is under French command. Colonel Arnoux
of the 116th Infantry has us in immediate charge with
General Gouraud in high command. Arnoux is an elderly
patient kindly man with a lot of seasoned young veterans
for officers and for Chaplain a big jolly Breton, whom the
men adore. The regiment is not much higher in strength
than our one battalion. Like all the regiments over here
it has been worn down by constant fighting and the difficulty
of finding replacements. During the week they got
something to show for the good work they have been
doing the past three years—the much desired Fourragère, a
bunch of knotted cords worn hanging from the left shoulder.
Our fellows call them “pull-throughs,” after the
knotted cords they pull through their rifles when cleaning
them. It was a very interesting ceremony. Our officers
were invited to it and those of our enlisted men who wore
the French Croix de Guerre. General Gouraud, a remarkable
military figure with an added touch of distinction from
his empty hanging sleeve and stiff leg—decorated the regimental
colors while the officers invested the men with the
coveted mark of distinction. The General reviewed his
American Allies, each of the officers being introduced by
Major Anderson. It was a formal affair until he came to
our bunch of husky soldiers who wore no silver or gold
insignia on their shoulders but carried on their breasts
the red and green ribbon of the Croix de Guerre. Then
you can see why every man in his army swears by him.
No cannon fodder here, but interesting human beings. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
liked him for it, and felt very proud of the men we had
to show him—Corporals Hagan and Finnegan of Company
F, Sergeants Coffey, Murray and Shalley of Company G,
and Sergeants Jerome O’Neill and Gunther and Corporal
Furey of Company H.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> I was saying to myself, “General,
you’re an old soldier but you never saw better men.”</p>

<p>It was a good thing for all of us to have met the General—a
man that any soldier would be proud to fight under,
but we were mighty careful not to tell him that a
phrase from a famous order of his was a by-word amongst
the American Officers under him. He had issued an address
couched along the lines of the Napoleonic tradition
in vigorous staccato phrases, preparing the hearts of his
soldiers for resistance unto death. The translator had
turned his last hopeful phrase, which promised them it
would be a great day when the assault was broken, into
English as “It will be a beautiful day.” Many of the high-ups,
both French and American, seem to think that the idea
of a general assault along these lines in a direction away
from Paris is a mare’s nest of Gouraud’s, but the debate
always winds up with the unanimous chant, “Oh, it will be
a beautiful day.” At present we are not in the front line
trenches, but in what are called the intermediate ones.
The General’s idea is to hold the front line with a few
French troops who will make themselves as safe as possible
against the vigorous shelling expected and withdraw behind
our lines when the German Infantry make their attack.
Then our fellows are to have the task of keeping goal. It’s
going to bring the battle right down to our doors, as the
battalion and company headquarters are only one or two
city blocks from where the hand to hand fighting will have
to take place.</p>

<p>I spend most of my time amongst the men and am very
much interested in finding out how their minds react at
the prospects of their first big battle. The other German<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
drives against the British and the French have been so
overwhelmingly successful that I was afraid the soldiers
might think that whenever the Germans get started they
were just naturally bound to walk over everything. I am
delighted to find that these bits of recent history have not
affected our fellows in the slightest. Jim Fitzpatrick of E
Company expressed the feeling of everybody when he said:
“Why would I be afraid ov thim? They’re just Dootchmen,
a’int they? and I never in me loife seen any four
Dootchmin that I couldn’t lick.” I have often read statements
by reporters about men being anxious to get into a
battle. I never believed it. But I find now at first hand
that here at least are a lot of men who are anxious to see
Heinie start something. I tell them that I am desirous
of getting into our first mix-up right here. This Division
has started out hunting trouble and if we don’t find it here
they will keep us sloshing all over France until we run into
it somewhere.</p>

<p>They will have need of all their courage, for if this general
attack is made it’s going to be a tremendous one. The
opinion of the French General staff seems to be that this
line will not be able to hold. At any rate they have been
making preparations with that contingency in view. The
whole plain behind us is organized for defense with our
other two battalions in rough trenches and the Engineers
in reserve. I hear they are bringing up also a Polish Legion
to take part in the support. They have Seventy-fives in
position for direct fire on German tanks, and machine guns
stuck everywhere with beautiful fields of fire across the
sloping plain. Everything is so charmingly arranged, that
I have a feeling that some of the people behind us have
a sneaking hope that the Germans will sweep across the
first lines so that they can be met by the pleasant little
reception which is being prepared for them further back.
However, I think that our friends back there are going to
be disappointed unless the Germans can spare a Division
or two to smother this battalion. Their orders are “Fight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
it out where you are,” which is Anderson’s translation of
Gouraud’s phrase, “No man shall look back; no man shall
retreat a step.”</p>

<p>Gouraud means it; and Anderson means it. I take great
pleasure in observing him these days. A young fellow yet,
just 29, and fresh from civil life—but a born soldier, with
the carefulness of a soldier in making plans and in looking
after his men, and the hardness of a soldier in ruling and
using men, and a streak of sentiment carefully concealed
which is a part of the soldier’s make-up. He has some
Scotch in him by his name—a good thing for the Irish if it
doesn’t make them Scotch-Irish—but the military tradition
in his bringing-up is on the Duffy side. It is interesting to
me to see the elements of school training showing in a man’s
character and views. In his views of life, discipline and
self-sacrifice, Anderson is a Christian Brothers’ boy. I
sometimes feel that old Brother Michael had more to do
with the making of Major Anderson as I know him, than
his own parents had. One result of his education had been
what most people nowadays would consider a detriment—his
devotion to duty is so sincere that it has produced the
effect of despising publicity; this he carries to an extreme.
Well, he may or may not win fame in this war, but one
thing I know, that the soldiers of his Company or of his
Battalion who alternately cursed and admired him during
the period of training are delighted to have him over
them in a fight and will unanimously rank him as one of
the greatest soldiers this regiment has ever produced.</p>

<p>Last night he and I made the rounds of all the trenches.
General Gouraud had picked it as a probable night for the
big attack, so we started around to get the men in right
spirits for it. The Major’s method was characteristic.
As the bright moonlight revealed the men in their little
groups of two or threes, the Major would ask, “What are
your orders here?” The answer always came, quick as a
flash, though in varying words, “To fight it out where we
are, sir.” “To let nothing make me leave my post, sir,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
and one, in a rich Munster brogue, “To stay here until
we’re all dead, sir.” “Then, will you do it?” “Yes, sir.”
Soldiers are not allowed to make speeches, but there’s the
most wonderful eloquence in all the world in the way a
good man carries his shoulders and looks at you out of his
eyes. We knew they would stick. I had my own few
words to say to each of them, whether they were of the
old faith or the new or no faith at all. We were two
satisfied men coming back for we knew that the old regiment
would give a good account of itself if the assault were
made. The night passed uneventfully and this morning I
was happy to have another Sunday for my own work. A
French priest, a soldier in uniform (a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">brancardier</i>), said
Mass for Company F in the picturesque little soldier’s
chapel that gives the woods its name, and gave General
Absolution and Communion, while I did the same in successive
Masses for Company G and Company H, and the
Wisconsin fellows.</p>

<p>I have served notice on Anderson that unless he produced
some kind of a war in the next twenty-four hours I
shall have to quit him. I had not been back to the Regimental
P. C. for nearly a week, so on Friday I told Joe
Hennessey that I wanted him to come up with a side car
and bring me down. The side car arrived yesterday morning
but with young Wadsworth running it. He had gotten
impatient hanging around back there with prospects of a
fight up front and he secured the privilege of coming up
for me so as to get nearer for a while at least to the
front line. It was a great pleasure to be at mess with
Colonels McCoy and Mitchell once more—a mutual one
evidently, for they both said that I had been too long
away and would have to come back. I begged off until
after Sunday.</p>

<p>Starting back on foot I ran into Major Donovan, who
as usual walked me off my feet. I had to visit every foot
of his position on both sides of the Jonchery road and I
was glad when Major Grayson Murphy came along in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
staff car and offered me a lift any place I wanted to go.
Donovan and I are both fond of Major Murphy, so I told
him I would go anywhere in the world with him so long as
he delivered me from D.</p>

<p>On our way back to P. C. Anderson the Corps Officer
who was with him gave his opinion that judging by past
performances the Germans should be able to advance at
least one kilometer in the massed attack that was threatened.
I didn’t say anything but it gave me a shivery feeling,
especially when I measured out a kilometer on one of
Anderson’s maps and wondered just what would have happened
to poor me by the time the gray mass of Germans
would reach the point that the gentleman from the Staff
had conceded them in his off-hand way. I needed the trip
around the trenches for my own reassurance and I stretched
myself out last night for a sleep with the comfortable feeling
that the decision in this matter was in the hands of an
aggregation of Irish stalwarts who care little for past performances
or Staff theories.</p>

<p>We are going to celebrate tonight. Lieutenant Rerat is
to bring over a few of the French Officers and the admirable
John Pleune is off scouring the countryside and the
French canteens for something to celebrate with.</p>

<p class="right"><em>July</em> 14th, 1918 11:00 <em>p. m.</em></p>

<p>We are here in Kelly’s iron shack. Lieutenant Tom
Young, a thorough soldier and a good friend of mine, and
old boy Finnerty and Harry McLean are waiting for the
bombardment. Everything that can be done for the men
has been done. There remains the simplest task in the
world, though often the hardest—waiting.</p>

<p>Our little Hands Across the Seas dinner was a jolly
affair. Anderson had Kelly and myself for guests with his
own staff; Keveny, Fechheimer and McDermott (Buck
Philbin—God bless him for a fine youth—was just ordered
back to the States and we miss him); and Lieutenant
Rerat brought along two good fellows like himself—a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
French-Irish Frenchman named DeCourcy (his ancestors
left France, on their mission to teach the English manners
and become good Irishmen themselves, somewhere around
1066, and one of their descendants came back to France
with the Wild Geese after the Broken Treaty of Limerick)
and a plump merry doctor whose name escapes me. The
viands were excellent—considering. And Dan Mellett had
done his noble best. Anyway, we made it a feast of song,
that is, the others did. John Fechheimer (whom Heaven
has sent us for our delight) has a complete repertoire, ancient
(dating back more than 10 years) and modern—College
Songs, Irish Songs, Scotch Songs, Negro Songs,
music hall ditties, sentimental ballads and modern patriotic
stuff—Upidee and Mother Machree; Annie Laurie and Old
Black Joe; After the Ball and The Yanks are Coming. De
Courcy received tremendous applause for</p>

<p>When Rerat had explained the verbal niceties of the diction,
all joined with enthusiasm in the classic verse</p>

</p>

<p>We compelled the Major out of loyalty to his native
heath to give us Down in the Heart of the Gas House
District.</p>

<p>Just then the Adjutant of Colonel Arnoux stepped in to
give us the news that the attack was certain and midnight
the hour. So we toasted France and America and departed
for a final inspection of positions. Everybody is as well
fixed as he can be made and I have picked this as the handiest
central place to await developments.</p>

<p class="right"><em>July</em> 15th, 1918</p>

<p>It was 12:04 midnight by my watch when it began. No
crescendo business about it. Just one sudden crash like an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
avalanche; but an avalanche that was to keep crashing for
five hours. The whole sky seemed to be torn apart with
sound—the roaring B-o-o-o-m-p of the discharge and the
gradual menacing W-h-e-e-E-E-Z of traveling projectiles
and the nerve racking W-h-a-n-g-g of bursts. Not that we
could tell them apart. They were all mingled in one deafening
combination of screech and roar, and they all seemed
to be bursting just outside. Some one of us shouted,
“They’re off”; and then nobody said a word. I stood it
about 20 minutes and then curiosity got the better of me
and I went out. I put my back against the door of the
hut and looked up cautiously to see how high the protecting
sand bags stood over my head, and then I took a good
look around. I saw first the sky to the south and found
that our own guns were causing a comfortable share of
the infernal racket. The whole southern sky was punctuated
with quick bursts of light, at times looking as if the central
fires had burst through in a ten-mile fissure. Then when
my ear became adjusted to the new conditions I discovered
that most of the W-h-e-e-z-z were traveling over and beyond,
some to greet the invaders, some to fall on our own
rear lines and back as far as Chalons. I crawled around
the corner of the shack and looked towards the enemy.
Little comfort there. I have been far enough north to see
the Aurora Borealis dancing white and red from horizon to
zenith; but never so bright, so lively, so awe-inspiring, as
the lights from that German Artillery.</p>

<p>I stepped inside and made my report to Lieutenant
Young, who was busy writing. He called for a liaison man.
Harry McLean—just a boy—stepped out of the gloom into
the candle light. He looked pale and uneasy—no one of us
was comfortable—but he saluted, took the message, made
a rapid Sign of the Cross, and slipped out into the roaring
night. A liaison man has always a mean job, and generally
a thankless one. He has neither the comparative protection
of a dugout or fox-hole under shelling, nor the
glory of actual fight. Our lads—they are usually smart<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
youngsters—were out in all this devilment the whole night
and I am glad to say with few casualties. Every last man
of them deserves a Croix de Guerre.</p>

<p>I wanted to see Anderson. He was only 40 yards away
by a short cut over ground. I took the short cut—we
were not allowed to use it by day—and had the uncomfortable
feeling that even in the dark I was under enemy
observation. It was the meanest 40 yards I had ever done
since as a lad of 12 I hurried up the lane to my father’s
door pursued by an ever-nearing ghost that had my shoulder
in its clutches as I grasped the latch. But I went in
now as then, whistling. Anderson and Rerat were there.
They had a word of comfort to tell; that General Gouraud
had planned to meet artillery with artillery and that our
fire was bursting on the enemy forces massed to attack us
in the morning. Just then a nearer crash resounded. The
major spun in his chair and fell; Rerat clasped his knee and
cried, “Oh, Father, the Major is killed.” The Major picked
himself up sheepishly as if he had committed an indiscretion;
Rerat rubbed a little blood off his knee apologetically
as if he had appeared with dirt upon his face at drill; and I
expressed jealousy of him that he had gotten a right to an
easy wound stripe.</p>

<p>Just then a gas-masked figure opened the door and announced
that there were two wounded men outside. That
came under my business and it was a relief to find something
to do. I followed the messenger—it was Kenneth
Morford—one of two good lads the Morford family gave
to the service. Around the corner I came on Jim Kane
badly hurt in the legs. Kenneth and I lifted him and carried
him with difficulty through the narrow winding trench
to the First Aid Station where we left him with the
capable Johnny Walker and went back for the second man.
It was Schmedlein—his folks were parishioners of mine—and
he had it bad. I was puffing by now and blaming myself
that I had not followed Major Donovan’s rules for
keeping in condition. As I bent to the task I heard Phil<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
McArdle’s voice, “Aisy now, Father. Just give me a holt
of him. Slither him up on my back. This is no work for
the likes of you.” I obeyed the voice of the master and
slithered him up on Phil’s back with nothing to do but
help Jim Bevan ease the wounded limb on our way to the
dressing station.</p>

<p>Corporal Jelley of H—a fine soldier—and Private Hunt
of E—he had a cablegram in his pocket announcing the
birth of his first born—had been killed by the shell that
struck in front of our dugout, and my friend Vin Coryell
wounded. We found later that some men of Company H
who had been sent to the French for an engineering detail,
had been killed—Corporal Dunnigan, whom I married at
Camp Mills; Patrick Lynn, Edward P. Lynch, Albert
Bowler, Russell W. Mitchel, Patrick Morrissey, James
Summers, Charles W. O’Day and Walter M. Reilley. Company
G had also suffered losses during the bombardment:
Paul Marchman, Theodore Sweet, Harold Cokeley, Patrick
Grimes, Patrick Farley, killed; with Corporal Harvey
J. Murphy and Charles J. Reilley fatally wounded.</p>

<p>Around P. C. Anderson there was plenty of shelling but
no further casualties until morning broke. At 4:30 the
firing died down after a last furious burst over our immediate
positions. The French soldiers in front began to
trickle back down the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">boyaus</i> to the defensive positions.
Our men crawled out of their burrows, eager to catch the
first sight of the enemy. A few wise old French soldiers
stood by to restrain them from firing too soon, for in the
half lights it is hard for an unaccustomed eye to discern
the difference between the Poilu’s Faded-coat-of-blue and
the field gray of the Germans. Nearly an hour passed before
one of them suddenly pointed, shouting, “Boche,
Boche!” The enemy were appearing around the corners of
the approach trenches. Rifle and machine gun fire crackled
all along the front. The Germans, finding that this was
the real line of resistance, went at their job of breaking
it in their usual thorough fashion. Their light machine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
guns sprayed the top of every trench. Minenwerfer shells
and rifle grenades dropped everywhere, many of them being
directed with devilish accuracy on our machine gun
positions. Many of ours were wounded. Sergeant Tom
O’Rourke of F Company was the first man killed and then
one of the Wisconsins.</p>

<p>That day the Badgers showed the fighting qualities of
their totem. Several of their guns were put out of action
at the outset of the fight, and practically all of them one
by one before the battle was over. In each case Captain
Graef, Lieutenant Arens and the other officers, together
with the surviving gunners, set themselves calmly to work
repairing the machines. Corporal Elmer J. Reider fought
his gun alone when the rest of the crew was put out of
action, and when his gun met the same fate he went back
through a heavy barrage and brought up a fresh one.
Privates William Brockman and Walter Melchior also distinguished
themselves amongst the brave, the former at
the cost of his life. There were many others like Melchior,
who, when their gun was made useless, snatched rifles and
grenades of the fallen Infantrymen and jumped into the
fight. As specialists, they were too valuable to be used up
this way and an order had to be issued to restrain them.
Sergeant Ned Boone, who knows a good soldier when he
sees one, said to me: “Father, after this I will stand at
attention and salute whenever I hear the word Wisconsin.”</p>

<p>Our own Stokes Mortar men fought with equal energy
and enthusiasm under Lieutenant Frank McNamara and
Sergeants Jaeger and Fitzsimmons with Corporals John
Moore, Gerald Harvey and Herbert Clark. They did not
take time to set the gun up on its base plates. Fitzsimmons
and Fred Young supported the barrel in their hands, while
the others shoved in the vicious projectiles. The gun soon
became hot and before the stress of action was over these
heroic non-coms were very badly burned.</p>

<p>During this interchange of fusillades the Germans were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
seen climbing out of the approach trenches and taking their
positions for an assault on the whole line.</p>

<p>They swept down on our trenches in masses seeking to
overcome opposition by numbers and make a break somewhere
in the thinly held line. Grenades were their principal
weapons-rifle grenades from those in the rear, while
the front line threw over a continuous shower of stick grenades,
or “potato-mashers.” An exultant cry went up from
our men as they saw the foe within reach of them. Many
jumped on top of the trench in their eagerness to get a
shot at them or to hurl an answering grenade. The assault
broke at the edge of the trench where it was met by cold
steel. It was man to man then and the German found who
was the better man. The assaulting mass wavered, broke
and fled. No one knew how it might be elsewhere, but
here at least the German Great Offensive had lost its
habit of victory. They were unconvinced themselves, and
hastened to try again, this time in thinner lines. Again
they were repulsed, though some of them, using filtering
tactics, got up into places where their presence was dangerous.
One of their machine gun crews had established
themselves well forward with their light gun, where it was
troublesome to the defenders, and an enemy group was
forming to assault under its protection. Mechanic Timothy
Keane came along just then in his peaceful occupation as
ammunition carrier, which he was performing with a
natural grouch. Seeing the opportunity, he constituted himself
the reserve of the half dozen men who held the position.
He found a gun and grenades and leaped joyously
into the fray; and when the attacking party was broken up
he called, “Now for the gun, min,” and swarmed over the
parapet. The others followed. The surviving Germans
were put out of action and the gun carried off in triumph.</p>

<p>Again and again the Germans attacked, five times in all,
but each time to be met with dauntless resistance. By
2:00 in the afternoon the forces of the attacking Division<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
was spent and they had to desist until fresh Infantry could
be brought up.</p>

<p>All this while and through nearly three days of the
battle the enemy used another power which proved in the
outcome to be more annoying than directly dangerous. We
had often read of superiority in the air when our side had
it. We were now to learn the reverse of the fine picture.
The German planes for two days had complete mastery.
They circled over our heads in the trenches, front and rear.
They chased automobiles and wagons down the road. You
could not go along a trench without some evil bird spitting
machine gun bullets at you. I doubt if they ever hit anybody.
It must be hard to shoot from an aeroplane. After
the first day they ceased to be terrifying—in war one
quickly learns the theory of chances—but the experience
was always irritating, as if some malicious small boy was
insulting one. And they must certainly have taken note of
everything we did. Well, it was no comfort to them.</p>

<p>When the Infantry assault was over the shelling began
again. They put minenwerfer in the abandoned French
trenches and threw over terrific projectiles into ours. They
dropped a half dozen shells on Captain Prout’s P. C. and
utterly ruined that humble abode. Prout, with recollections
of his native Tipperary, said, “Yes, Father, I got
evicted, but I never paid a penny of rent to any landlord.”</p>

<p>In spite of these events the issue of the day’s battle was
not in doubt after 10:00 o’clock that morning. There had
been anxious moments before, especially when many machine
guns were put out of action and the call for further
fire from our artillery met with a feeble response. I
dropped in on Anderson. True to his motto, “Fight it out
where you are,” he was putting the last touches to his preparations
for having his clerks, runners and cooks make the
last defense if necessary.</p>

<p>“Do you want some grenades, Padre?” was his question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span></p>

<p>“No, Allie,” I said, “every man to his trade. I stick to
mine.”</p>

<p>“Well here, then: this is my battalion flag,” stroking the
silk of the colors. “If things break bad in the battle you
will see that it don’t fall into the hands of the enemy. Burn
it up if it is the last thing you find time to do before you
go.”</p>

<p>“All right, I shall look out for your flag. That is a
commission that suits my trade.”</p>

<p>And I received what was to be his last bequest—if things
went bad. I said no more, but in my ears was humming
“Down in the heart of the Gas House District in Old New
York.”</p>

<p>They breed good men there. Over in Anderson’s old
Company E, now in the able hands of Captain Baker, there
were a lot of Anawanda braves who met the attack with
the same fiery zest as their comrades on the left, as I shall
tell in its place. I was not long with Anderson when in
sweeps Kelly as brisk and jaunty as if he were on his way
to the Fair at Kilrush in his native County Clare on a fine
Saturday morning.</p>

<p>“How are things going, Mike?” said the Major.</p>

<p>“No trouble at all,” said the Captain. “We’ve got them
beat.”</p>

<p>But there was still trouble ahead. All afternoon the
trench mortar shells and whiz-bangs kept bursting in the
whole sector, making the work of litter bearers and liaison
men very difficult. Also the task of burying the dead, which
Mr. Jewett of the Y’s athletic department volunteered to
superintend for me with the sturdy assistance of Corporal
Michael Conroy of Company H.</p>

<p>Company H was in support—the most thankless and difficult
sort of a job for any unit, whether Company, Regiment
or Division. It is called upon for detachments which
must go up under shell fire, and go in where the battle is
hottest, and in unfamiliar surroundings. The unit generally
gets little public credit for its share in the fight though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
military men know that it is a compliment to be held in
support. It means that the Chief Commander has confidence
that the smaller fractions into which it may have to
be split are under well trained and competent leaders.
However, nobody likes the job. Certainly big courageous
Captain Jim Finn did not like it. He wanted to lead his
own company in the fight and the H men would rather
fight under their great hearted Captain than under any
other leader in the world. That pleasure was denied them,
but the Company surely did honor to the training and the
spirit their Captain put into them. I saw a platoon going
up the boyau with Lieutenant Wheeler, all of them flushed
with the joy of action. “Over the top with Fighting Joe,”
called John O’Connor, from the words of Tom Donohue’s
song. Their services were needed often on the 15th to support
the gallant defenses of Companies F and G.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 16th there was another furious
assault. A whole German Battalion attacked one of the
defense positions and for a time the situation looked serious.
Lieutenant Young of F was killed while organizing
the resistance. Lieutenants Wheeler and Anderson of H
and Sears of F took all kinds of chances in meeting the
situation and were carried off wounded. Some parties of
Germans managed to get up into the trench. Joe Daly,
while carrying ammunition, almost ran into a German. The
latter was the more excited of the two, and before he could
recover his wits, Daly had snatched a rifle which was leaning
against the trench, whirled it over his head like a shillelah,
and down on the German’s skull. Then he ran into
the middle of the fight.</p>

<p>Sergeant Bernard J. Finnerty and Corporal Thomas
Fitzgerald of H saw a group of Germans who had ensconced
themselves in an angle of the approach trench
whence they were doing terrible damage with their potato
mashers. Michael Tracy, a crack shot, who had done great
work that day with his rifle, made a target of himself
trying to find a better spot to shoot from, and got wounded.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
But they had to be dislodged. So Finnerty and Fitzgerald
rushed down the trench, hurled over hand grenades into
the party, and destroyed it—but at the cost of their own
heroic selves. John F. O’Connor, Mechanic of Company
O, jumped on the parapet to get a position to bomb out a
machine gun crew which were sheltered in a hollow. He
drove them into the open where our own machine guns
settled them.</p>

<p>The places of the wounded Lieutenants of H Company
were taken by Sergeants Eugene Sweeney and Jerome and
William O’Neill (two of “The three O’Neills of Company
H”; the third, Daniel, being First Sergeant, was with Captain
Finn). In Company F Sergeants Timothy McCrohan
and Thomas Erb with Corporals James Brennan and John
Finnegan led the fighting under Captain Kelly and Lieutenants
Marsh and Smith. Bernard Finnegan and Matt
Wynne refused to quit when badly wounded. William
Cassidy, Company Clerk, who could not content himself
with that work while the fight was on, and Corporal
Michael Leonard, an elderly man who had volunteered
when men with a better right to do so were satisfied to
wave the flag—these too won great renown. They and the
others routed the enemy out of the trenches, following them
over the top and up the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">boyaus</i>. Cassidy and Leonard
were killed, and my old time friend, Sergeant Joe O’Rourke
of H, and many another good man. Sergeant William
O’Neill was wounded, but kept on fighting, till death
claimed him in the heat of the fray. His brother, Jerome,
still battled valiantly and he was always worth a hundred
men.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Eugene Sweeney was twice wounded and refused to retire
till the enemy was chased utterly from the field. When<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
his wounds were dressed he insisted on returning to the
lines.</p>

<p>Corporal John Finnegan had been wounded in the leg the
day before. He tied a bandage around the wound and
stayed where he was. He was with Lieutenant Young
when that leader was killed and ran to avenge him. A
shell burst near him and he was hurled in the air, falling
senseless and deaf. I saw him in the First Aid Station,
a little way back, where he had been carried. The lads
there had ripped up his breeches to re-bandage his earlier
wound. He was just coming to. They told me he was
shell shocked. “Shell shocked, nothing,” I said. “A shell
could kill John Finnegan, but it could not break his nerves.”
Just then he got sight of me. “There’s nawthin’ the matther
with me, Father, exceptin’ that I’m deef. They got the
Lootenant and I haven’t squared it with thim yet. I’m
goin’ back.” I told him he must stay where he was at least
till I returned from the Battalion Dressing Station, which
was 500 yards down the old Roman Road.</p>

<p>Going out I saw Marquardt, Hess and Kleinberg carrying
a litter. I offered to help and found it was Dallas
Springer, a dear friend of mine since Border days, now
badly wounded. We got him with difficulty down the
shelled road to the Battalion Dressing Station where I
found the Surgeons, Doctors Martin, Cooper and Landrigan
working away oblivious of the shells falling around.
Landrigan had been out most of the night of the big
bombardment arranging for the evacuation of the wounded.
I put Dallas down beside Michael Leonard, a Wisconsin lad
named Pierre, and Harold Frear, a slim, plucky lad whom
we had rejected at the Armory for underweight when he
applied for enlistment just a year ago, but who had pestered
us all till we let him by. I was told that Lester Snyder of
our Sanitary Detachment had been brought in nearly dead,
a martyr to his duty, having gone out to bandage the
wounded under heavy fire. It was a consolation to me to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
recall the devout faces of all five of them as I gave them
Communion a day or two before.</p>

<p>Between looking after these and others who kept coming
in it was a good while before I got back to the First Aid
Station in the trenches and John Finnegan was gone. They
had kept him for some time by telling him he was to wait
for me. But after a rush of business they found John
sitting up with a shoe lace in his hand. “Give me a knife,”
he said, “I want to make holes to sew up my pants.” Johnny
Walker had mine but he wouldn’t lend it. “Lie down and
be still.” “All right,” said Finnegan, “I have the tools
God gave me.” He bent his head over the ripped up
breeches and with his teeth tore a few holes at intervals in
the hanging flaps. He carefully laced them up with the
shoe-string, humming the while “The Low Back Car.”
Then he got up. “Where’s me gun?” “You are to wait
for Father Duffy. He wants to see you.” “Father Duffy
done all for me I need, and he’d be the last man to keep
a well man out of a fight. I’m feeling fine and I want me
gun. I’m going back.” He spied a stray rifle and seized
it. “Keep out of me way, now, I don’t want to fight with
the Irish excipt for fun. This is business.” So wounded,
bruised, half deaf, John Finnegan returned to battle. Immortal
poems have been written of lesser men.</p>

<p>The attacks on the position of Company G were not so
bitter and persistent as Company F had to sustain. The
G men felt rather hurt about it, but their genial Captain
smilingly tells them that it was because the enemy know
they could never get a ball through where G Company
soldiers kept the goal. On the 15th the enemy certainly got
a taste of their quality. A strong attack pushed in at a
thinly held spot and were making off with a machine gun.
Lieutenant Ogle mustered his platoon, sped over the top
and down upon the enemy with grenades and cold steel.
A short sharp fight ensued. The gun was carried back
with shouts of laughter and in a few moments was barking
with vicious triumph. Sergeant Martin Murphy, Corporals<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
John Farrell, Michael Hogan and Thomas Ferguson—four
soldiers of the jolly, rollicking Irish type, were
Ogle’s mainstays in this dashing fight. Lieutenant Boag
was wounded, but his platoon was ably handled by Sergeant
John McNamara.</p>

<p>When Prout’s dugout was smashed to pieces by shell fire,
Sergeant Martin Shalley, who is the very type and pattern
of the Irish soldier, took charge of the rescue work and
dug out the buried men in time to save their lives. Another
shell destroyed the kitchen of Cook William Leaver.
Thus relieved from his peaceful occupation he got himself
a gun and belt and ran out into the fight garbed in his blue
overalls. Michael Foody, tiring of being made the cockshot
of aeroplanes which were flying low over the trenches, determined
to try reprisals, and leaning back against the
trench, began to discharge his automatic rifle in the direction
of one that was particularly annoying to him. It was
a long chance, but before he had emptied his feeder he had
the joy of seeing the plane wabbling out of control and
finally making a bad landing back of the German lines.</p>

<p>Corporal John G. Moore lived up to the best traditions
of his gallant Company. He had been wounded but refused
to go back. Later his post was suddenly occupied by
half a dozen Germans. They called upon him to surrender,
but Moore does not know that word in German or in any
other language. He says he took it to mean a command
to fire, so he started to put hand grenades over the plate
and the two Germans that were left made quick tracks for
the exit gate. Moore’s delivery is hard to handle. Alfred
Taylor also proved his mettle by sticking to his post when
wounded and insisting furthermore on joining a raiding
party the same day.</p>

<p>Raiding parties were G Company’s stock in trade. Lieutenants
Ogle and Stout revel in them. They were out at
night looking for the trouble that did not come their way
often enough by day. One of these patrols fell upon what
they called a bargain sale and “purchased” new German<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
boots and underwear for the whole Company. John Ryan
got left behind in one of these raids and had to lie for two
days in a shell hole with Germans all around him. He
finally got back with valuable information concerning movements
of the enemy.</p>

<p>Further to the east and separated from the other companies
by a battalion of the 10th Chasseurs was Company E
under Captain Charles D. Baker. During the bombardment
only one man, Michael Higgins, was killed. The attacks
of the enemy on the next two days were of the filtering
kind, and were easily repulsed, George McKeon being
the only man slain.</p>

<p>By the 18th they began to grow weary of these trivial
actions and Captain Baker ordered two platoons to go
a raiding. The first platoon, under Lieutenant Andrew L.
Ellett and Acting-Sergeants Malloy and McCreedy, went up
the boyau on the left. They had not gone a quarter of a
mile when they saw Germans in a trench. Douglas McKenzie,
in liaison with the French, reported them as gathering
for an attack. The Lieutenant climbed out of the trench
to get a better view, and Matt Cronin got out behind him
with his automatic rifle to start things going. Some of
the enemy were in plain view and Cronin’s weapon began
pumping merrily. The enemy responded and he received
a wound. The fight was on. It was a grenade battle. Our
men rose to it with the same zest they had shown when
they fought their boyish neighborhood fights, street against
street, in Tompkins Park or Stuyvesant Square. But this
was to the death. Both Sergeant Malloy and Archie Skeats
took that death in their hands when they caught up German
grenades out of the ditch and hurled them back at the
enemy. Lieutenant Ellett’s men were far from their base
of supplies. Three times they fell back along the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">boyau</i>
as their ammunition ran out; and three times with fresh
grenades they advanced to meet the foe. The Lieutenant
was wounded, but a hole or two in him never mattered to
Andy Ellett. He withdrew his men only when he felt he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>had done all that was necessary. Then he handed over his
charge to Sergeant Frank Johnston, a warrior every inch,
who had joined up with Anderson’s old company for the
war because he knew Anderson of yore. He had fought,
with him many a time in the Epiphany Parish School.</p>

</figure>

<p>The other platoon was commanded by Lieutenant Tarr
with William Maloney and Michael Lynch as Sergeants.
Dick O’Connor, who always went to battle with song, was
the minstrel of the party, his war song being “Where do we
go from here, boys?” John Dowling, Cowie, Joyce, Gavan
and McAleer went ahead to scout the ground. They passed
through some underbrush. Suddenly they flushed two Germans.
Dowling fired and shouted, “Whirroo me buckos,
here’s our mate.” His cry was answered by Maloney, a
mild-mannered Celt, who knows everything about fighting,
except how to talk of it afterwards. Lieutenant Tarr gave
the order and led his whole platoon over the top across
the level ground and up to the trench where the Germans
held the line. It was grenades again and hand to hand
fighting on top of it. A party of the Germans fled to the
left. They heard the battle of Ellett’s platoon from there
and they turned with upthrown hands and the cry “Kamerad.”
Dowling helped the first one out of the trench
by the ear. “Aisy now, lad, and come along with me.
The Captain is sitting forninst the blotter to take your pedigree.”
Back went most of the platoon with the prisoners,
their mission accomplished. Eleven prisoners had been
taken and fifty Germans left dead upon the field. But the
never satisfied Maloney elected himself to cover the retreat
with Hall, Breen and Hummell; and with such a leader
they kept battling as if they were making a Grand Offensive
until they were ordered to withdraw.</p>

<p>I have been to the Third Platoon of Company E and
everybody talked about that patrol at once. Everybody
except Maloney. But everybody else was talking about Maloney.
I looked around to see what Maloney would have to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
tell. And I found no Maloney. Maloney had fled, sick of
hearing about Maloney.</p>

<p>This was practically our last shot in the battle. The
German attack had evidently come to a complete standstill.
They even lost their command of the air on the
afternoon of the 17th, when a fleet of British aeroplanes
had come along and driven them to cover. On our part
we were preparing to become the aggressors. The 3rd
Battalion was being brought forward to relieve the 2nd,
and to take command of both came our good old Lieutenant
Colonel, jaunty and humorous as always in a fight and
without a worry except as to whether he and I had enough
smokes to last. All care vanished when my orderly, Little
Mac, sneaked up from where I had left him in the rear,
bringing two cartons of cigarettes.</p>

<p>Today we received definite word of what had happened
meanwhile in the support Battalions. During the bombardment,
young Wadsworth was killed at Headquarters, and I
lost other good friends in Company B—Sergeant Harry
Kiernan, as good a man as he looked, and that is a great
compliment; Arthur Viens, one of my own parish lads,
and Joseph Newman, and Archie Cahill, mortally wounded.
Louis Cignoni of Company C and Sam Forman of the
Machine Gun Company were also killed. Sergeant Charles
Lanzner of Company A was killed while doing brave work
as a volunteer carrying a message to Company B under the
fearful cannonading. The Polish Battalion also had met
with a savage reception that night.</p>

<p>The French gave news that the enemy was held in every
part of the long front, with the exception of a portion of
the line around Chateau Thierry and running up the northeast
side of the salient. The old Rainbow had not a single
dent in it. I got our fellows stirred up by telling them
that they had gone and spoiled one of the loveliest plans that
had ever been prepared by a General Staff. “What do you
mean, spoil their plans? All we spoiled were Germans!”
“That’s just the trouble. The men who planned this battle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
did not really expect you to stick, and they were all ready
to give the Germans a terrible beating after they had
walked through you and gotten out into the open space.
The trouble was that you fellows did not know enough to
run away, and the Generals finally had to say, ‘We shall
have to scrap our beautiful plans and fight this battle out
where those fool soldiers insist on having it fought.’”</p>

<p>Around midnight we were told that we would be relieved
by morning. Why? No one knew. Where were we going?
No one knew. The French were to take our place. They
were slow in coming. We wanted to be away before sunrise
or the enemy would have a fine chance to shell our
men as they made their way over the plains. I waited
the night there in Kelly’s shack, impatient for the relief to
come ere dawn. Finally the Poilus, their blue uniform almost
invisible by dark, began to appear. I started off with
Mr. Jewett down the road to St. Hilaire. We picked up
Bill Neacy with a Headquarters detachment, and found a
back road down to Jonchery. I watched for the dawn and
German planes, filled with anxiety for our withdrawing
columns. But dawn came and no shelling, and shortly
afterwards I fell into the kindly hands of Major Donovan,
and soon good old John Kayes and Arthur Connelly had a
beefsteak on the fire for us. The 2nd Battalion came drifting
in in small parties, and reported everybody safe. Then
I saw Pat Kinney and knew that the Colonel was somewhere
about. He had come out to look after his men. I
certainly was glad to see him, and I got the reception of a
long lost brother. He bundled me into his car, and in a
short time had me wrapped in his blankets and taking a long
deferred sleep in his cot at Bois de la Lyre.</p>


<h3>VADENAY</h3>


<p class="right"><em>July</em> 21st, 1918</p>


<p>We packed up our belongings in the Bois de la Lyre on
July 20th and went to this town of Vadenay. Colonel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
McCoy had a ceremony that afternoon which shows one
reason why we are so devoted to him. I had written up
the recommendations for citations furnished by Company
Commanders during the recent battle; and the Colonel, fearing
they might not go through, embodied them in a regimental
citation and read them to the assembled soldiers. It
was fine and stimulating; the 2nd Battalion is as proud as if
it had won the war and the others are emulous to equal its
fame.</p>

<p>I went back to my billet and found a visitor who announced
himself as Father James M. Hanley of the Diocese
of Cleveland. I remembered the name. I received a letter
some two months ago, a fresh breezy letter, full of the unrestrained
impatience of a young priest who had come over
to take part in the war and had landed in an engineer outfit
not far from a base port. He appealed to me as an old-timer
to tell him how to beat this mean game. I answered
and told him what to say to Bishop Brent, and Bishop
Brent, nothing loth, had sent him to me for the 42nd
Division. The more I talked with the new Chaplain the
more 69th he looked to me; so I said to him: “I am going
to keep you with me. Father McDonald is in ill-health and
has orders for a new assignment. We shall have a big
battle in a week or two and we shall need two men because
there is a good chance of one of us being bumped off.
Major Anderson’s battalion will very probably be in reserve
so you report to Major McKenna and tag along with
him. I shall tie up with Major Donovan.”</p>

<p>The next day was Sunday. It was the first day the
whole regiment was in one place since we left Camp Mills.
There was a beautiful church in the town and I announced
four masses with general absolution and communion without
fasting. In all my life I never saw so many men at
communion in one day. The altar rail was too narrow to
accommodate them, so we lined them up on their knees
the length of the aisle, and two priests were kept busy
passing up and down giving communion. The non-Catholics<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
we took in groups near their companies and had brief
exhortation and silent prayer.</p>

<p>I never use the motive of fear in talking to soldiers about
religion because it does not suit with their condition, and
anyway I can get more substantial results without it. But
the government and the army believes in preparedness for
death, as is shown by their ambulances and hospitals and
pensions. I believe in spiritual preparedness; so too, do the
men. I am happy to think that my own charges are well
prepared. May the grace of God be about them, for I feel
we are in for a big fight.</p>

<p>One thing sure, they are not afraid of it. Coming in to
Vadenay I saw Amos Dow, a stripling youth of Company
K, just back from the hospital after four months of absence—he
was terribly gassed last March and his condition
then had me much worried. He was still looking none
too well.</p>

<p>“What brought you back,” I asked. “You are not fit
for this kind of work yet.”</p>

<p>“Well, they did offer me other jobs, but I wanted to be
with my own outfit, and I wanted to get a Dutchman after
what they did to me, and I was sick of hearing the Marines
talk about how good they are. I want to get into a first
class battle with this Division like you’ve been through
while I was coming up, and when I meet those birds from
the Marines, I’ll have something to say to them.”</p>

<p>“You’re a blood-thirsty youth. But far be it from me to
stop you. It’s your trade. But you can’t carry a pack, so
I’ll fix it up to make it easy for you.”</p>

<p>“Joe,” I called to Sergeant Flannery, “I want you to get
Captain Mangan and Lieutenant Kinney to adopt this
savage child in the Supply Company for a week or two.
See that he gets up where he can smell powder, but without
too much hiking, and then give him his belt and rifle and
let him go to it.”</p>

<p>“I had better get a lariat and a picket pin and tie him
up,” growled Joe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span></p>

<p>He was right. By morning the lad was gone off with
Company K. He was afraid I would spoil his chance for a
battle.</p>

<p>The survivors of our 2nd Battalion are camped in a
wooded island in the stream and I spent the afternoon with
them. The weather was delightful and they were enjoying
a lounging, lazy, gossipy day, which is the one compensation
for being in the Infantry—the artillery have fewer
killed, but their work never lets up. I went amongst them
to pick up incidents for my narrative. One of the first
things I found was that the recent battle had given them increased
confidence and respect for their officers. A Company
F man said to me: “I’ll take back anything I ever
said about Captain Mike. At Baccarat he had me fined two-thirds
of three months pay for taking a drink too much
and I said that if I had the job of rigging him up for a
night patrol, I’d like to tie bells around him and put a lantern
on his head.”</p>

<p>My first visit was to Company H, which had been the
greatest sufferer. In addition to the names I have already
cited, one of the most frequent on all men’s lips was that of
Dudley Winthrop. Dudley is a fine youth and one of my
best friends. I tell him that he has a name like a movie
actor, but he says he can bring around two cousins of his
named Connelly from Company G to prove that he belongs
to the Fighting Race. I hope he gets the Croix de Guerre
he has been put in for, for he certainly deserves it. Patrick
J. Dwyer, William Gordon and Daniel Marshall are also
cited by their fellows for sticking it out while wounded,
with Thomas McDermott, who was tagged for the hospital
and refused to go. High praise also for Martin Higgins (a
born fighter) and Andrew Murray, Dan McCarthy, Sergeant
Val. Dowling, William Smythe, Sammy Kleinberg,
whom I saw going around all week cheerfully carrying
the wounded with the clothes burned off his back by a misdirected
flare; Tom Heaney, Robert Cooper, Michael
Kearns, James O’Brien, John Thornton, John A. Fredericks,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
Donald Gillespie, John F. Lynch, Joseph Mattiello,
with cooks Pat Fahey and Gorman, Timothy Walsh, Peter
Breslin, John J. Walker, Charles Rogan, Michael Higgins,
Dennis Kerrigan, James Guckian, John J. McCormack,
James Todd, John Kelly, Frank Garvin, Lawrence Farrell,
Bill Fleming, Charles Klika, William McNamee, James
Merrigan, John Maher, Harold Avery, Patrick Connors,
John P. Furey, Frank Condit, Robert McGuiness, John
Higgins, James Keane, Patrick Travers, Thomas Slevin,
John Ryan, John and James French, Bruno Guenther, Daniel
Dayton, Frank Doran, Charles Ziegler. The men who
were on the digging detail that had such heavy losses in the
bombardment praise the coolness and solicitude for their
safety of Lieutenants Becker and Otto.</p>

<p>Company G talked most about their Captain, the serenest
pleasantest, and most assuring person in the world in time
of trial and danger. Also Lieutenants Ogle and Stout,
Norris and Joseph Boag, who was wounded in the fray.
I myself had seen Carl Kemp of the same Company on
duty at Battalion Headquarters standing through the bombardment
on the top of the parapet on his duties as lookout.
Sergeant Jim Coffey, wounded and still fighting; and,
in the same class, Ralph Holmes and John Flanigan; James
Christy, working his automatic from the top of the
trench; Dennis Roe, always a good soldier in a fight;
Sylvester Taylor and Joseph Holland, liaison men;
Sergeants Jim Murray, Edward McNamara, Thomas T.
Williamson and Frank Bull, Mess Sergeant Hugh Lee;
James Henderson, Thomas Gallagher, William McManus,
Michael Hogan, William Carroll, Morris Lemkin, Dennis
O’Connor, John McNamara, John Conroy, Frank McNiff,
Joseph P. Alnwick, Patrick Burke, Patrick Duffy, David
Fitzgibbons, Angelo Dambrosio, James Keavey, Nicholas
Martone, Lawrence Redmond, James Ryan and John Ryan,
the Hans brothers; Thomas Slevin, Herbert Slade, James
Walsh, Allen, Henry Curry and John Fay as Company
liaison; Arthur Ayres, George Murray, Herman and Lyons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
as litterbearers; Louis Mugno, Maurice Dwyer, Patrick
Keane, Charles McKenna, James Elliott, mechanics; Michael
Hogan, Patrick Burke, young O’Keefe, Robert Monahan,
Frank Garland; and, to end with a good old Irish
name, Mack Rosensweig. I know he’ll be with us if we
ever get a chance to go over and free Ireland, and he’ll
be a good man to take along.</p>

<p>In Company F it was all praise for Captain Mike and
praise and regrets for Lieutenant Young. I did not need
to have them tell me anything about their liaison group,
as I saw them at work—from the Corporal in charge, John
H. Cooke, who, though wounded, stuck at his job, to Harry
P. Ross, John J. Carey, Leon Duane, John Gill, William
Grimson, Harry McLean. Sergeant Major Michael J.
Bowler did good work looking after the wounded. Tom
Kenney carried in Lieutenant Anderson and I saw James
Bevan do good service in the same line; also Marquardt,
Goble, Gray and Harry Rubin. First Sergeant Joseph
Blake was a cool leader, as also Charles Denon, Leo McLaughlin,
and Tim McCrohan. Of those who were
wounded and stuck, the name of Sergeant Eugene Cunningham
was mentioned, as also John Butler, Edward Callan,
John Catterson, Albert Curtis and James Brennan. Pat
Frawley (one of the best soldiers the regiment ever had),
was wounded and stuck, was knocked senseless and still
stuck. Others who distinguished themselves in hand to
hand fighting were Patrick McGinley, Peter Sarosy, Thomas
McManus, Malcolm Joy, always lively in a fight; and on
the Roll of Honor the popular vote placed Sergeant Phil
Gargan, whose kitchen was ruined (“wounded at Lunéville,
killed in Champagne,” said Phil); James P. McGuinn, Oscar
Youngberg, William Gracely, Hugh Haggerty, Lewis
Edwards, Michael Gettings, Joseph McCarthy, John J. Tyson,
James Moran, Edward Moore, James Kelly, Cornelius
Behan, Ned Boone, James Branigan, Tom Cahill, James
Coogan, Joseph Coxe, Morris Fine, Dick Leahy, Nat Rouse,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
and, to end once more with a good Irish name, “Pat”
Levine.</p>

<p>Company E added to my extended list the names of
James A. Donohue, Walter Dowling, Ray Dineen, and
most of all, Fred Gluck, who rendered heroic service as litter
bearer. At Headquarters the Colonel himself spoke enthusiastically
about the good work of young Joe Hennessy,
who was on the road at all times on his motorcycle, oblivious
of danger even after being wounded. I found that
Company M was carrying Corporal Dan Flynn as A. W.
O. L. on its records. Dan had gone up to the Second Battalion
on paper work and finding that a fight was on he got
himself a rifle and stayed there till it was over.</p>

<p>We are all well satisfied with the spirit of every man in
the regiment during the last fight. I had but one recommendation
to make to Colonel McCoy. The Company litter
bearers are left to the selection of the Captains. Now the
Captains are chiefly interested in front line work and they
refuse to spare a good rifleman for any other task. But
the litter bearers have a task which is most trying on
morale and physique, and it will not be easier if it comes to
open warfare, where they will have to stand up when the
fighting men lie in shell holes. The litter bearers acquitted
themselves well in this fight, but I feel strongly that nothing
is too good for the wounded. I want the Colonel to
insist that one man in every four be a picked man who
will go and keep the others going on their work of human
salvage until every man drops in his tracks. I would select
in every four men one of our solid Irish, of the kind that
with death all around, hears nothing but the grace of God
purring in his heart.</p>


<h3>CHAMIGNY SUR MARNE</h3>


<p class="right"><em>July</em> 24th, 1918</p>


<p>Sur Marne—there is magic in that. I have always
wanted to see the Old Regiment add the name of that river,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
so full of martial associations, to the history-telling silver
furls on its colors. We are not in battle yet. Nothing
could be more peaceful than the scenes in which we live,
if one shuts one’s eyes to uniforms and weapons. The
broad, silvery Marne forms a loop around the little village
and the commodious modern chateau (owned, by the way,
by an American), in which we live. We revel in our new
found luxury. Following a motto of this land, “We take
our good where we find it.” I got a variation of that as I
came into the lordly halls and stood staring around me.
Sergeant Major Dan O’Connell gave a signal like an Orchestra
Leader to the Adjutant’s Office Force and McDermott,
O’Brien, Jimmy Canny, White, Monahan, Farrell,
Whitty, with Dedecker and Dietz joining in, sang deliberately
for my benefit, “There’s nothing too good for the
I-i-i-rish.” A sentiment which meets with my hearty approval.</p>

<p>A diary is a sort of magic carpet; it is here, and then it
is there. Three days ago we hiked it from Vadenay to the
nearby station of St. Hilaire-au-Temple where we entrained
for parts to us unknown. Our 2nd Battalion and the Wisconsins,
which formed one of the sections, had the mean
end of a one-sided battle while waiting at the station. The
German bombing planes came over and started dropping
their “Devil’s eggs.” C-r-r-unch! C-r-r-unch! C-r-r-unch!
the face of the earth was punctured with deep holes that
sent up rocks and smoke like a volcano in eruption; the
freight shed was sent in flying flinders, but the train was
untouched. Animals were killed, but no men.</p>

<p>“We don’t know where we’re going but we’re on our
way” might be taken as the traveling song of soldiers.
We dropped down to Chalons, crossed the river, going first
in a southeasterly direction to St. Dizier, then southwest to
Troyes, and rolling through France the whole night long
we came in the morning as near Paris as Noisy-le-Sec, from
which, with glasses, we could see the Eiffel Tower. Judging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
from our experience with the elusive furlough, that is
as near to Paris as most of us will ever get.</p>

<p>We were impressed with the new enthusiasm for American
soldiers among the French people; every station, every
village, every farm window was hung with colors, some
attempt at the Stars and Stripes being common. And stout
burghers, lovely maidens, saucy gamins, and old roadmenders
had a cheer and a wave of the hand for “les braves
Americains, si jeunes, si forts, si gentils,” as the troop
train passed by.</p>

<p>“Looks as if they knew about the big battle we were in,”
said Lawrence Reilly.</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it,” said the grizzled Sergeant Harvey. “I
have seen the Paris papers and nobody but ourselves knows
that the Americans were in the Champagne fight. These
people think we are fresh from the rear, and they are giving
us a good reception on account of the American Divisions
that hammered the Jerries three or four days after we
helped to stand them up. Isn’t that so, Father?”</p>

<p>“I think you’re right, Sergeant. For the time being what
you fellows did is lost in the shuffle.”</p>

<p>“Who were these other guys?” asked Mike Molese.</p>

<p>“They say it was the 1st and 2nd Divisions up near
Soissons and the 26th and 3rd around Chateau Thierry.”</p>

<p>“How is it these fellows manage to get all the press-agent
stuff and never a thing in the paper about the 42nd?”
asked Tommy Murphy.</p>

<p>“Well, those other fellows say that it is the Rainbows
that get all the advertising.”</p>

<p>“Well, if I ever get home,” said Bobby Harrison, “I’ll
tell the world that none of those birds, regulars, marines
or Yankees, have anything on the Rainbow.”</p>

<p>“Oh, what’s the difference?” said the philosophical John
Mahon, “as long as it is American soldiers that are getting
the credit.”</p>

<p>“Do you subscribe to those sentiments, Kenneth?” I
asked John’s side partner, Hayes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span></p>

<p>“I certainly do, Father.”</p>

<p>“Then I make it unanimous. This meeting will now
adjourn with all present rising to sing the ‘Star Spangled
Banner.’”</p>


<h3>CHATEAU MOUCHETON, EPIEDS</h3>


<p class="right"><em>July</em> 26th, 1918</p>


<p>Somebody is always taking the joy out of life. We had
but three days in our pleasant villages on the Marne when
they routed us out and lined us up on a hot, broad highway,
where we waited for the French camions which were to
take us towards the field of battle. Finally they arrived—a
long fleet of light hooded trucks, each driven by a little
sun-burned, almond-eyed, square-cheeked Chink—Annamese
or Tonquinese, to be more accurate. We sailed in
these four-wheeled convoys past what is left of the village
of Vaux (the completest job of destruction we had yet
seen, the work of our American artillery) through Chateau
Thierry, which had only been pecked at in comparison, and
northwest to the town of Epieds.</p>

<p>Here we witnessed one of those melodramas of war,
for the sight of which most civilians at home would sell, I
am sure, one year of their lives. There were four of our
observation balloons in the air. Four or five German attacking
planes were circling above them intent on their
destruction; and a few doughty French flyers were manœuvering
to resist them. The convoy paused on the road to
watch the result of the combat. In fact, all the roads converging
there were brown with canvas hoods and khaki
uniforms. Both the stage and the accommodations for
spectators were perfect. The spectators arranged themselves
along the roadside; the scene was set in the clear sky
overhead. Suddenly one of the Germans darted high in the
air over the balloon on the extreme left. Anti-aircraft guns
barked viciously, and the ether broke out in white and black
patches around him, but he managed to place himself where
they could not fire at him easily, as he had the balloon in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
the line of fire from the strongest battery. Then he turned
and swooped down on the balloon, swift as a hawk at its
prey. He swerved upwards as he passed it and all four
Germans soared rapidly upwards and away. We saw
something drop suddenly from the balloon, which rapidly
developed into a parachute with two observers clinging to
it. A thin wisp of smoke which we could detect from the
balloon then burst into flames, and the blazing material began
to drop towards the parachute. But the automobile to
which the silk observation tower was attached began to
move, and the fiery mass missed the parachute on the way
down. We were glad that the observers had escaped, but
we felt that in this first round of our new battle we had to
concede first blood to the enemy.</p>

<p>We hiked from Epieds—a pleasant walk—to this fine
chateau, the main building of which is occupied by French
Staff Officers of a Corps d’Armée. Our headquarters is in
a large outbuilding, the men being in the nearby woods. I
have been circulating around amongst our 1st Battalion and
also the Ohios on my own particular concerns. Took supper
with Company D. Buck is away, as Major Donovan
has taken his four company commanders on a reconnoitering
expedition, since his battalion is to be first in. Had supper
with Lieutenants Connelly, Daly and Burke. Daly is a
fine, intelligent active youth, graduate of Holy Cross and of
the Old Irish 9th Mass. Burke got his training in the regular
army. He is a soldier of the silent determined kind,
and a very efficient officer, with no blamed nonsense about
him. The other three of us, of a more normal racial type,
cannot see any sense in being too sensible. Connelly winked
at me and began to “draw” Burke by expressing envy of the
lucky birds who had gotten orders to go back to the States.
Daly played up strongly, and Burke’s face showed ever-increasing
exasperation and disgust. Finally he blurted:
“Father, why don’t you shut these slackers up? We’re here
to see this thing through, and such talk is bad for morale.”
When I laughed as loud as the rest he grinned and said:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
“Oh, I know that if they gave you fellows New York City
with Boston to boot, neither of you would go back.” A
true statement, as I know. I paid for my supper by hearing
their confessions.</p>



<p class="right"><span style="padding-right: 3em"><em>Later</em></span></p>


<p>The reconnoitering party came in for a severe shelling,
and Buck has gone back wounded and Hutchinson gassed.
Donovan is back here, also gassed, but ready to go in again
if they want his battalion, though his orders to relieve the
French have been countermanded. While I am writing,
a polite French Staff Officer came in with the word that
the original orders should stand. Donovan buckled his
harness on anew and went out to lead his battalion forward
once more. I posted myself in the gateway of the Chateau
and gave absolution to each Company as it passed. Then
I hastened out on the main road, and made similar announcements
to the Ohios, as that regiment moved up to
the front. There is every evidence that we are in for a
battle, big and bloody.</p>


<h3>COURPOIL</h3>


<p class="right"><em>July</em> 27th, 1918</p>


<p>We spent last night in this shell-torn town, and this
evening we take up the pursuit of the withdrawing Germans.
Donovan’s battalion is out getting touch with them
and McKenna is starting up too. The 84th Brigade has
already relieved the 26th American Division and a Brigade
of the 28th and have been in a hard battle with the enemy
at Croix Rouge Farm. It took all their undoubted courage
to sweep over the machine gun nests, and they succeeded
in doing it at the price of a battalion. The roads coming
down are filled with ambulances and trucks carrying the
wounded and dripping blood. We are relieving the 167th
French Division, but nothing seems definitely settled, and
messengers are coming and going with orders and counter
orders. I have greater admiration than ever for McCoy
these days. He moves in war as in his native element, expending<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
his energies without lost motion or useless friction.</p>

<p>Tonight we go to the Chateau de Fere. If the Germans
decide to make a stand at the Ourcq we shall be in
action by tomorrow.</p>

THE BATTLE OF THE OURCQ</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Croix Rouge Farm</span> was the last stand of the Germans
south of the Ourcq but it was expected that they would
make some sort of resistance on the slopes and in the woods
north of this river.</p>

<p>To get to the battlefield from the south one can go on a
broad highway running straight north for five miles
through the thickly wooded Foret de Fere. Near the northern
point of the woods is an old square French Ferme—the
Ferme de l’Esperance, and a more pretentious modern
dwelling, the Château de Foret. A little further north one
comes to the contiguous villages of La Folie and Villers
sur Fere. On the map they look like a thin curved caterpillar,
with the church and the buildings around its square representing
the head. Beyond the square a short curved
street known to us as “Dead Man’s Curve” or “Hell’s Corner”
leads to the cemetery on the left, with an orchard on
the right. From the wall of the orchard or cemetery one
can see the whole battlefield of our Division on the Ourcq.
A mile and a half to the left across the narrow river is
Fere en Tardenois blazing, smoking and crackling all the
week under the fire of artillery, first of the French, then
of the Germans. About the same distance to the right and
also north of the river, lies the village of Sergy where the
Iowas were to have their battle. To get the Ourcq straight
across the line of vision one faces to the northeast. The
eye traverses a downward slope with a few clumps of trees
for about eight hundred yards. The river, which would be
called a creek in our country, has a small bridge to the left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
and another a little to the right as we are looking, near the
Green Mill or Moulin Vert. Straight ahead beyond the
river is a valley, and up the valley a thousand yards north
of the river is a house and outbuildings with connecting
walls all of stone, forming a large interior court yard.
It is Meurcy Farm. A brook three or four feet wide runs
down the valley towards us. Its marshy ground is thickly
wooded near the Ourcq with patches of underbrush. And
about two hundred yards west of the Farm is a thick square
patch of wood, the Bois Colas. North of the Farm is a
smaller woods, the Bois Brulé.</p>

<p>The whole terrain naturally slopes towards the Ourcq.
But tactically the slopes that were of most importance in
our battle were those that bound the brook and its valley.
Facing the Farm from the bottom of the valley one sees
to the left a gradual hill rising northwestwards till it
reaches the village of Seringes et Nesles, which lies like
an inbent fish-hook, curving around Bois Colas and Meurcy
Farm half a mile away. To the east of the brook the
rise goes up from the angle of the brook valley and the
river valley in two distinct slopes, the first, fairly sharp,
the second gradual. Six hundred yards or so north of
these crests is a thick, green wall across the northern view.
It is the Forest of Nesles. The difficulty of attacking up
this little valley towards the Farm lay in the fact that it
made a sort of trough, both sides of which could be easily
defended by machine guns with a fine field of direct fire, and
also by flanking fire from the opposite slope as well as from
Meurcy Farm and Bois Colas which lay in the northern
angle of the valley. And when the attackers got to the top
of the eastern crest there were five hundred yards of level
ground to traverse in face of whatever defences might be
on the edge of the Forest.</p>

<p>With plenty of artillery to crack the hardest nuts, and
with regiments moving forward fairly well in line so that
the advance of each would protect the flanks of its neighbors,
the problem would not have been a terrific one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span></p>

<p>But nobody knew for certain whether the enemy would
make more than a rear guard action at the Ourcq. His
general line still constituted a salient and his ultimate line
was sure to be the Vesle or the Aisne. It takes time to
get Artillery up and in place. And the Germans might slip
away scot free on account of our too great caution in following
him. Miles to right and left allied troops, mainly
French, were hammering at both sides of the salient. It
was the duty of those who followed the retreating enemy
to see that his retirement with guns and other property
should not be too easy a task.</p>

<p>In our progress to the slopes above the Ourcq there was
little resistance in the path of our brigade. The night of
the 27th, General Lenihan established brigade headquarters
at the Château de Foret. The Ohios were in the forest
in brigade support, as the first plan was to send in one
regiment. Our second battalion was in regimental reserve
and was held by Anderson in the woods to the left of the
road, his principal officers being Lieutenant Keveny, Adjutant,
and in command of the four companies, E, F, G, H,
Captains Baker, Kelly, Prout and Finn. Colonel McCoy
had established his post of command near the church at
the northern end of Villers sur Fere. With him was the
Headquarters Company under Captain Michael Walsh, and
nearest to him was the third battalion under Major McKenna,
with Lieutenant Cassidy, Adjutant, and Companies
I, K, L, M, commanded by Captains Ryan, Hurley, Merle-Smith
and Meaney.</p>

<p>Major Donovan with the first battalion, Lieutenant
Ames, Adjutant, and the Companies A, B, C, D, commanded
by Lieutenant Baldwin, Captain Reilly, Captain Bootz
and Lieutenant Connelly with our Machine Gun Company
under Captain Seibert, had gone forward on the night of
the 26th and relieved the French west of Beuvardes. On
the afternoon of the 27th they had passed east through the
Foret de Fere and had come out on the crest over the river
between Villers and Sergy, the lines being widely extended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
to keep in touch with the Iowas on the right. Here
we witnessed the first operation of cavalry in our battles.
A small squadron of French cavalry came out of the woods
and proceeded down the road south of the river in the direction
of Sergy with the intention of drawing the enemy fire.
It was a beautiful sight to see the animated group of horses
and men tearing down the road, but a spectacle that did not
last long, as very shortly they drew a powerful enemy fire
and after some losses cantered back to the woods with their
main object accomplished. Our Infantry was thus drawn
into the battle but with little opportunity to accomplish much
as the enemy were relying principally on heavy shell fire.
Of ours, Company C suffered the greatest losses, as Corporal
Morschhauser, William V. Murtha and John F. Ingram
were killed and Sergeant John F. Vermaelen with
Frank Dunn, William Ryan and Harry Fix mortally
wounded. Major Donovan drew his battalion back behind
the reverse slope of a hill where it was protected from observation
by trees, and there ordered them to dig in for the
night.</p>

<p>He had detached Company D, under Lieutenant Connelly,
to find and maintain liaison with the French on the left.
The Lieutenant got in touch with our own 3rd Battalion
which was already coming up on that side. Lieutenant
Burke of D Company, with Eugene Brady, kept on to find
the French to the westward, but just as he started out
he received a dangerous and painful wound in the leg. He
stopped only long enough to have it tied up and then, in
spite of protest, he insisted on carrying out his task. He
tramped over fields and through woods for four hours that
night before his work was complete and there was no danger
of the derangement of plans, and then permitted them to
carry him back to the hospital. His wound was so severe
that it took months and months to heal, but Burke is the
kind of soldier who will carry out any task he is given to do,
if he has to finish it crawling.</p>

<p>In the early hours of Sunday, July 28th, the disposition of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
the regiment was as follows. Colonel McCoy with his
Headquarters Company, Major McKenna’s Battalion with
Company D of the 1st Battalion, and a Company of the
Wisconsin Machine Gunners were in the town of Villers
sur Fere and in the orchards east of it. Major Donovan
with Companies A, B and C, and our Machine Gun Company
were further east in the direction of Sergy. Our
2nd Battalion was two miles behind and to the west, the
Ohios being still further west on the same line. A battalion
of the Alabamas had come up behind Major Donovan
to take the ground he had occupied between Villers
sur Fere and Sergy. In front of Sergy the Iowas were
already set. West of Villers sur Fere the ground was held
by the French, their main effort being concentrated on the
capture of Fere en Tardenois. It was reported through the
night that they already had that town, but they did not
cross the river until well on into the next morning.</p>

<p>Under normal battle conditions Colonel McCoy would not
have been justified in having his Post of Command right up
with the advance elements of his regiment as they went into
battle. But he was a bold as well as a careful commander,
and he felt that he could best handle the situation by being
where he could see just what was going on.</p>

<p>For two days the situation had been changing from hour
to hour. First it was planned to have Major Donovan relieve
the forward elements of the French Infantry on Friday
night. Then on Friday morning came a corps order for
the 42nd Division to attack on Saturday morning. It was
then arranged between General Menoher and the French
Division Commander to have two battalions of ours, Donovan’s
and McKenna’s, relieve the French that night. As we
have seen, the order to attack was recalled and the relieving
battalions were sent back. But the two division commanders
decided that the relief should be effected and that
these two battalions should take the front line with Anderson
in support and the 166th in reserve. On Saturday came
word that the enemy had withdrawn with the French Division<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
to our left in pursuit. The 166th were to relieve them
when the situation settled.</p>

<p>On Saturday morning came General Order 51. “Pursuant
to orders from the Sixth (French) Army, 42nd Division
will attack at H. hour, under cover of darkness, night
of July 27-28.” The four infantry regiments were to attack
abreast, a battalion of each being in line. “The attack
will be in the nature of a surprise, and consequently troops
in the attack will not fire during the assault, but will confine
themselves to the use of the bayonet.”</p>

<p>At 1:00 P. M. Saturday, July 27th, the order was given
to execute the relief and await further instructions. Our
advance elements were already on the way and the 1st
Battalion of the Ohios came up in the rear of the 10th
French Chasseurs to make reconnaissance with the purpose
of relieving them.</p>

<p>An hour after midnight General Lenihan received a message
from Colonel MacArthur containing an order from our
1st Army Corps, that the attack be made before daylight and
without artillery preparation, reliance being placed chiefly
on the bayonet to drive the enemy from his position.
Cavalry were to be in reserve to follow up. General Lenihan
ordered all of our three Battalions to take part in the
attack.</p>

<p>Colonel McCoy was sent for and the order was given him.
Major McKenna expressed his opinion of the order in a
manly, soldierly way. Captain Hurley of Company K had
felt out the enemy resistance during the night and had
found machine gun nests just across the river, the enemy artillery
also being very active. The assumption of a retreating
enemy against whom infantry bayonets and charging
cavalry could be effective was not justified by what the
front line could detect. It was a case for artillery preparation
and careful advance. Colonel McCoy was already of
the same opinion, which he expressed with proper vigor.
They were three good soldiers, Lenihan, McCoy and McKenna,
and they all felt the same way about it. But it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
a Corps Order, an Army order, in fact, commanding a general
advance. Whatever might be the cost, it could not be
that this regiment should not do its share to keep the
advancing line in even contact with the enemy. So when the
hour arrived the Colonel gave the order to advance, which
order was communicated by Major McKenna, to Hurley,
Ryan and Merle-Smith, Meaney being in reserve. Orders
were also sent to Colonel Donovan on the right to move
his battalion to the west, taking advantage of the woods,
and then to cross the river. Lieutenant Colonel Mitchell
brought orders in person to Anderson to bring his battalion
forward and cross the Ourcq on the left of McKenna,
which would bring him to the slope on the west of the little
brook leading towards Bois Colas.</p>

<p>Meanwhile General Lenihan at 3:20 A. M. had received
word from General Brown of the 84th Brigade that he
could not be sure of having his regiments in line in time
for the assault. As a matter of fact, the Iowas, under
Colonel Tinley, were already abreast of Donovan; and the
assault battalion of the Alabamas, under Lieutenant Colonel
Baer, was rapidly coming up behind. About 5:00 A. M.
General Lenihan received word that the French were not in
Fere en Tardenois. He decided that it was too hazardous
to push the attack and word was sent at 5:15 o’clock
to Colonel McCoy to suspend his advance temporarily pending
the advance of neighboring organizations.</p>

<p>But the old regiment had a motto to live up to, “Never
disobeyed an order, never lost a flag.” McKenna had given
his orders to his Captains who all knew just what it meant—and
the men under them knew it. Many of them, most of
them, as it turned out, would be dead or wounded up that
pleasant little valley and along its eastern slopes before the
sun rode at mid-heavens. But no man was daunted by the
thought.</p>

<p>The first wave was to be Company K, already so cruelly
tried by the gas attack at Lunéville. Their leader was Captain
John Patrick Hurley, whose slender form and handsome<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
ascetic face seemed to mark the poet or the student
rather than the soldier. But he was a keen soldier, one
whose blood pumped full and even when death was flying
round. Company K was willing to die for him or with him
anywhere. At his command they moved forward in advance
formation with intervals all perfect at a walk, a trot,
a run, down to the Ourcq. It was a sight to remember
while life would last, as perfect as a peace manœuvre but
with death all around. In that short advance Sergeant
Frank Doughney and Corporal Raymond Staber, the heroic
son of Mount Loretto, found their way to heaven; and a
number of good men were wounded. But they swept on
over the Green Mill bridge and across its dam and through
the waters of the river with Captain Hurley and Lieutenant
Pat Dowling in the lead, and did not stop till they had
gained a footing under the bank of the road beyond the
river.</p>

<p>Right on their heels came Company I under the Boer
War Veteran, Captain Richard J. Ryan, in the same perfect
formation. They, too, swept across the Ourcq (Eddie
Joyce being the one man killed), and took up their place
with Company K under the bank. The two Captains reformed
their men and were looking over the situation. Their
objective was Meurcy Farm. But that lay in the valley and
was impossible to take until at least one of the slopes was
cleared to its summit; as a direct advance would expose
them to fierce enfilading fire. Even where they were, one
group of enemy machine guns could fire direct on their
flank; so Captain Ryan sent one of his best men, Sergeant
E. Shanahan, with Hugh McFadden, Pat McKeon, Hettrick,
Hartnett and others to put it out of action. A forlorn
hope, he felt, but they did it without losses, as Shanahan
was a born leader.</p>

<p>The line was scarcely straightened out when the men
were given the word to advance. The left of Company K
moved out on the lower slopes along the little valley towards
Meurcy Farm; the right of K and all of I at an angle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
straight up the bare, smooth slope towards the machine gun
nests that were spitting fire from that direction. That kind
of action suited Pat Dowling. He jumped to his feet and
called to his platoon to follow, when a machine gun bullet
gave him a mortal wound. Sergeant Embree and John J.
Conefry fell by his side. A heart-broken soldier lifted the
Lieutenant. “Did they get that machine gun on the right?”
“Yes, sir.” Then, “Thank God!” and a dauntless leader of
men was no more.</p>

<p>The line swept on. The slope to the right ran through a
wheat field and then with a gentle rise to the summit. In
the lower portion there was a group of machine guns
manned by good men. But they had to deal with better
men. The line swung around the guns in a semi-circle, the
men crawling on their bellies like Indians now. The rifles
were crackling all around, their sharp bursts of fire drowning
at times the incessant pop, pop, pop of the machine guns.
Many of the German gunners were killed and the others
found it nigh impossible to lift their heads from their holes
to work the pieces. Not one of them offered to surrender.
Most of them died at their posts. A few sought safety
in flight and some of these managed to slip back up the hill
to safety. We met some of these men long afterwards.
They spoke of the sweep of the Battalion across the Ourcq
and said they thought Americans were crazy.</p>

<p>Meanwhile big gallant Merle-Smith with Company L had
crossed the river and had fallen into line on the hill to the
right of Company I. Major McKenna, anxious to extend
his flanks as far as possible, had thrown in Company D,
half of it on the right of L, well into territory that belonged
to the neighboring regiment, and half to the left rear of K,
up the valley towards the farm.</p>

<p>The men who had the farm for their objective fared the
best. At that moment it was not very strongly held and the
shoulder of the hill protected them from fire from its summit.
Sergeants Meade and Crotty, with a platoon of Company
K, followed by Lieutenant Cook, with two platoons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
of D, worked their way up the valley. There was a sharp
fight under the stone walls of the old building and gallant
Bob Foster there found the death that was sure to be his in
battle. Carl Nyquist of L was also killed. Finally, rifles
were thrust through the windows and the last of the Germans
retreated across the courtyard and out the other side.
While searching for food (soldiers always go into battle
after a long fast), Corporal John Gribbon found one lone
German hiding in the cellar and sent him to the rear. Other
soldiers ran into the orchard like school boys and picked
green apples to satisfy their hunger. Sergeant Crotty was
sent to establish a line of sharp-shooters to keep down the
fire from the edge of Bois Colas, and Sergeant Dick O’Neill
held the Farm with his platoon of Company D, until the
Germans, learning from their own fugitives that it had been
evacuated by their men, shelled the defenders out into the
open.</p>

<p>The main attack had harder going. Near the crest of
the hill was a new line of German guns much stronger than
the first and with a magnificent field of fire that swept
almost every part of the slope. Now that their own men
at the base were out of the way, the German Artillery,
too, had more freedom to act, and shells began to drop
along the slope, carrying destruction. The whine of bullets
was incessant and the quick spurts of dust spoke of
imminent death. But still the line kept crawling forward,
each man keeping his resolution to the sticking point with
no exhilaration of a headlong charge nor even a friendly
touch of shoulder. In attacks such as this each man must
crawl forward in isolation, keeping his interval from his
neighbors lest destruction should reach too many at one
time. It is the finest test of courage.</p>

<p>The machine guns were the worst—and not alone those in
front. The main attack was up the slope on the east of the
brook valley. Across the narrow valley along the edge of
the Bois Colas until Anderson’s men cleaned them out; and
outside Seringes, the Germans had other guns which kept<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
up a galling flanking fire on our third battalion. And from
their right on their unprotected flank more guns were at
work. Before the hill was half won many were wounded
or killed. Company K, on the left, exposed to the fire
across the valley, was the first to suffer heavily. Lieutenant
Gerald Stott was badly hit—mortally, as the event proved.</p>

<p>Father Hanley, whose disposition did not permit him to
remain at the dressing station, had gone over the river
with Captain Hurley and he rushed forward to save the
wounded Lieutenant, followed by Sergeant Peter Crotty
with Ted Van Yorx and George Meyer. The dust began
spurting around them and Father Hanley went down with
a bullet in the knee. Despite his command to the men that
they should not risk themselves, the three brave lads carried
him in, and also Lieutenant Stott.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Arnold made a desperate attempt to get in
behind the machine guns on the crest by following a drain
on the lower slope. He had gotten well forward when
he was mortally hit. Sergeant John Ross went ahead to get
him, but was struck dead by the side of his Lieutenant, as
were James Daley of K, and John Hession of L.</p>

<p>Of the five Kellys of Company K, two, John and Francis,
both daring youths, were killed. Howard was badly
wounded in the leg, Herbert was not yet back from the
gassing at Lunéville. Young Jimmy, a lad of seventeen,
alone remained, and battled as if he felt he had to do the
fighting for the whole clan. Of the five Sullivans, Jim was
the only one hit and he refused to quit the field. The same
is true of Sergeant D’Acosta and Victor Van Yorx and
Mike Bannon and also Herbert McKenna of the Mount
Loretto boys of Company K. The other lads of his school
showed their training that day. Besides Raymond Staber,
George Duffy, Joe Gully and Tom Fleming paid the big
price for their patriotism. So too, did another much beloved
lad in the Company, James Scott; and Cox, Grey,
Patrick Ristraino, Patrick Caulfield, Hugh Quinn, Will
Ring, and Patrick Cunningham (the last three in front of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
Meurcy Farm), with Lewis Shockler, James Daly, Sylvia
and Dale, Sharp and Ramsey, who received their death
wounds on the slopes of the hill. This was a heart-breaking
day for Captain Hurley, who loved his boys, but he kept on
cheerful to outward view with his two remaining Lieutenants,
Metcalf and Williams, and non-coms like Meade,
Farrell, Crotty, Bernard McElroy, John Gibbons and others
already named. But soon Lieutenant Metcalf was sent
back wounded and Williams was the only Lieutenant left.</p>

<p>At the extreme right of our line was Company L with
the remnants of two platoons of Company D under Lieutenants
Connelly and Daly. Captain Merle-Smith was hit
early in the day, a bullet piercing his arm as he raised it to
signal his men forward. He had a first aid bandage
wrapped round it and then forgot about it, as there was
too much to do. Lieutenant Wellborne also was hit and
refused to quit the field. In his platoon Sergeant George
Kerr, a great favorite in the company, was fatally wounded.
He was picked up by Sergeant Will Murphy (I always
wanted to make a priest out of Will, but he was none the
worse soldier for that), and carried down the hill; but
George died before the bottom was reached and Murphy
himself was badly wounded.</p>

<p>In the 2nd Platoon Lieutenant Watkins was killed in the
very front line. Near him fell Sergeant Tom O’Donovan
and Bert Landzert, good friends of mine since Border
days. Lieutenant Spencer was also wounded doing courageous
liaison work, as well as Lieutenants Leslie and Booth
and Knowles, who had battalion duties and were there to
help in co-ordination. The 4th Platoon was led into action
by my loyal friend, Sergeant John Donoghue—like Tom
O’Donovan, a Killarney man, and both fine specimens of
the Irish soldier. He was hit very badly in the early part
of the fray, but remained there for hours spurring on his
men. His place as leader was taken by Sergeant Ray
Convey, a deep, sincere, religious youth whom the whole
Company admired. He was a gallant leader, till death and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
glory claimed him. The same quick route to heaven was
taken by Corporal Neil Fitzpatrick, wounded the night before
but still in the fray, and Dave O’Brien, a quiet saint
and a model soldier. Owen McNally also, and the two
Coneys boys, George Heinbock, John J. Booth, and two
youths dear to all for their nobility of character, Lawrence
Spencer and Bernard Sheeran. With Lieutenant Watkins
and Sergeant O’Donovan and Convey on the hilltop lay Mat
Moran and Mario Miranda, Earl Weill, Roland Phillips,
Herbert Stowbridge, M. Simpson, John Hayden, Harold
Yockers, Elmer Shaner and Preston Carrick, Dan Reardon,
Alexander Jornest (Russian) and James Santori (Italian),
all making the same sacrifice for the land of their birth or
adoption.</p>

<p>Arthur Turner, Walter McCarty, E. J. Morrissey, Raymond
Murphy were killed in town. William J. Ormond,
James Cook, James Watson, Herbert Ray and Leroy McNeill
died of wounds.</p>

<p>Johnnie McSherry, the irrepressible youngster, and Maurice
Hart, the staid veteran, were both carried from the
field. Sergeant Arthur McKenny was wounded and carried
into Meurcy Farm, where he was afterward made prisoner
by the enemy. Of the two McLaughlin brothers, Dan was
wounded unto death, while doing great work, and Harry,
less severely. Two other brothers of the same name, Longford
men, Bernard and Thomas McLaughlin, battled
through it all and came out unscathed. The three McCabes
fought like Maccabees. Sergeants Bezold, Thomas
Kiernan and Bernard Woods were wounded, but Sergeant
William Malinka, Tom Dunn and Leo Mullin came
through.</p>

<p>On the left of L and in the middle of the line, Company
I held the field and suffered even greater losses; but they
too kept working steadily forward and no man went back
whose duty it was to stay. Lieutenant H. H. Smith was
killed on the last slope, urging his men forward. Sergeant
Frank McMorrow and William Lyle, Paddy Flynn,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
and Hugh McFadden kept the platoon going. Lieutenant
Cortlandt Johnson, like Captain Ryan, kept moving all along
the line unmindful of danger, until he was badly wounded.
His platoon was in good hands. Sergeant Charles Connolly
took command and kept them advancing till death
called him from the fray. Across his body fell Tommy
Brennan, his closest friend—“In death not divided.” Sergeant
Billy McLaughlin, a thorough soldier, took command
but five minutes later he, too, was killed as he led the advance
shouting, “Let’s go and get ’em, men!” Otto Ernst
and John O’Rourke were killed at the very top of the hill,
but Lenihan and Vail, Adikes and Lynch, still held the survivors
together until they, too, were wounded. John J.
Maddock, a veteran of the Regular Army, was badly hit
while trying to save Corporal Beckwith.</p>

<p>Here, too, fell Lieutenant Beach, killed by shrapnel while
shooting an automatic. Along side him lay in a row like
harvest sheaves, Matt O’Brien, William Corbett, Roger
Minogue, Patrick McCarthy, Patrick McKeon, Floyd Baker,
Louis Bloodgood and James Powell. Sergeant Charlie
Cooper escaped severely wounded and Dan Mullin led what
was left of the platoon.</p>

<p>It was at the top of the hill that the Captain was
wounded, a bullet going through his left side. Before he
fell he had looked the situation over. The forward lines
were now able to see clearly the whole field. In front the
terrain stretched over perfectly level ground for five hundred
yards to the edge of the forest of Nesles where one
could detect the prepared emplacements and regularly wired
positions. It was useless to advance in that direction; not a
man could ever cross that stretch alive. To the right a company
of the Alabamas had come up, but they, too, had been
swept to pieces by the German fire and no more managed
to reach the top. To the left, across the valley, our second
battalion had begun to work its way up the opposite slope
towards Seringes. Their fire could be detected as they
wormed their way forward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span></p>

<p>Looking back down the hill the sight was discouraging.
The ground was littered with the bodies of the brave, and
the slopes of the Ourcq were dotted with the wounded,
helping one another to the dressing station across the river
in Villers sur Fere.</p>

<p>Half the battalion was out of action. Of five Lieutenants,
Hurley had lost three killed, and one wounded. Merle-Smith
was wounded and also three of his four officers, the
fourth being killed. Eugene Gannon, a brave and competent
soldier, was now his second in command. Ryan,
badly wounded, was the only officer left in I, though he had
well placed confidence in his first sergeant, Patrick McMiniman,
a rock-ribbed old-timer, and Sergeants Shanahan and
Patrick Collins.</p>

<p>All three commanders decided that the position on the
top of the hill was untenable. When they had swept over
the last emplacements of the German guns on the hill they
not only found that their own further advance was impossible;
they had also left the German artillery free to act, and
the shelling began with terrific vigor. So the main body
drew back a little below the crest, leaving automatic gunners
and sharp-shooters to keep the Germans from venturing
forward from the woods. Our own machine guns, the
Wisconsin lads manning them, had followed the advance,
the gunners fighting with desperate courage. The ammunition
was carried up by their men and ours at a fearful
cost. Five feet or so a man might run with it and then go
down. Without a moment’s hesitation, some other soldier
would grab it and run forward to go down in his turn.
But the guns had to be fed and still another would take the
same dreadful chance. Death was forgotten. Every man
thought only of winning the fight. Finally the guns were
put out of action by shell fire at the top of the hill and
there they stood uselessly, their gunners lying dead around
them.</p>

<p>Death was busy on that hill that morning. It claimed
Johnnie Bradley, the baby of the Company, for whom life<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
was still an unexplored field; and Ben Gunnell of the
Northwest Mounted Police, who had tried most earthly
things and found them wanting. Pat Stanley, who had left
his kitchen to fight, found a noble end to his fighting. Arthur
Matthews, mortally wounded, spent what remained to
him of breath, calling words of encouragement to his companions.
Two men worked side by side,—one was taken
and the other left. Frank Mulligan and Frank Van Bramer
worked an automatic. Van Bramer was called. John
O’Hara went the long road and Jim O’Connor stuck it out
untouched. Frankie Connolly took the automatic from McCarthy’s
dead hands and kept it going all morning. Eddie
Martin and Will Corbett, liaison men, were shot down, and
Charlie Garrett wounded. The voices of Thomas Curry
and Henry Lynch and Arthur Thompson were hushed forever.
Frank Courtney, Will Flynn, Earl Rhodes, Thomas
Boyle, Carl Moler, John McCabe, Harold Van Buskirk,
Louis Ehrhardt, Fred Muesse, Darcy Newman, Melvin
Spitz, kept up the fight of that bare hillside with no thought
of retreat until their heroic souls were sped. Charles Ford
and Spencer Ely, Albert Schering and Thomas Shannon
were carried from the field and died of their wounds.</p>

<p>Captain Hurley, in command of the battalion on the hill,
had gone down to confer with the Colonel. Captains Ryan
and Merle-Smith were both wounded. The latter kept
cheerfully moving around amongst his men, while Ryan
had to lie in a depression and try to keep up the spirits of
his followers by calling to them. When his voice failed
him, Paddy Flynn, a clean-cut young Irish athlete, came and
lay along side him and coached the team like a captain on
the base lines. As he raised his head to call he was hit on
the cheek, but he kept on urging resistance until he was
finally wounded severely. Paddy Hackett’s voice was also
heard throughout the fight urging the old gallants to stick,
until he, too, found his place among the heroes of the regiment
that are gone.</p>

<p>And still the remnants of the battalion held their ground,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
though that ground was being plowed by shells. They had
the hill; and if a general forward movement was on, as they
had been told, it was their place to hold that hill till the
other organizations could come up, even though the last man
amongst them should remain there for his long sleep. Captain
Meaney had sent up reinforcements to piece out the
thinned line. A platoon under Lieutenant Ahearn arrived,
but reinforcements only added to the slaughter. What was
needed was artillery fire and strong supporting movements
on the flanks. Lieutenant Ahearn was wounded and two
of his best Sergeants, Patrick Clark and Patrick Hayes.
Sergeant William Francis was killed, also Corporals Patrick
Cooke and George Hoblitzell, one of two fine brothers; and
Patrick Byrne, Hubert Hill, James Scanlan, John Tobin
and John Donahue fought their last fight. Mat Mahoney,
Frank Cullum, John Powers and Bill Conville, with many
others, were badly wounded.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Connelly had tried to remove Captain Ryan
from the field. But the Captain threatened to shoot anybody
who would attempt to take him away from his men.
Finally, about noon, Captain Merle-Smith came to him with
information that the order had come to withdraw through
the 1st Battalion, which already occupied the lower slopes of
the hill.</p>

<p>That task remained to carry in the wounded. Company
M gave great help, but every man who could walk lent a
hand to this task of friendship. Corporal Dynan, who had
already done more than his share of the fighting, got
wounded finally while helping others off the field.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Williams remained out to hold the advance
position with a platoon of Company K, including Sergeants
Joe Farrell and Peter Crotty, Corporals George Meyer,
Patrick Ryan, John Naughton and John McLaughlin.</p>

<p>The survivors were a sorry remnant of the splendid battalion
that had so gallantly swept across the Ourcq that
morning. But they had carried out a soldier’s task.</p>

<p>Disputes may arise about the orders that sent them in
but they will not affect the place in the martial annals of
their race and country which was made on that day of tragic
glory by the Shamrock Battalion of the old Irish regiment.
Laurels grow from the graves of the dead. Laurels,
too, encircle the brows of every man who fought that day
on Hill 152.</p>

<p>Still further news of tragedy waited for them. Their
gallant Major was dead. Major McKenna had tried to
recall his Company when the word came to countermand
the attack order. But his wild Irish had rushed to the attack
with too much eagerness for that, and the situation was
beyond mending in this way. They could not retreat under
the fire of the machine guns on the hill which could mow
them down as they recrossed the river with nothing gained
from their sacrifice. They had to go ahead and put these
guns out of action. When he had seen how things were
going, the Major started back along the Ourcq to consult
with Colonel McCoy. A shell came over knocking the
Major down and wounding his Adjutant, Lieutenant Cassidy.
When the Lieutenant, with Sergeant Major Joyce and
George Strenk, ran to pick him up, they found him dead,
though without a wound upon his body. They bore him in
sorrowing, as every man in the regiment sorrowed when the
news went round, at the loss of a brave and beloved leader
whose talents fitted him for a high destiny if life were
spared him, but to whom had fallen the highest destiny
of all, and one which he had always expected would be his—that
of dying for his country.</p>

<p>His Company Commanders had been informed of his
death not long after it happened, and Captain Hurley had
taken general direction of the fight when Ryan was
wounded. Hurley came back to report on the situation to
Colonel McCoy, and while talking to him was badly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
wounded by shell fire. The Colonel had already made up his
mind on the matter and Major Donovan, with the 1st Battalion,
was crossing the river to effect a relief.</p>

<p>But meanwhile another battle, scarcely less fierce, had
been going on on the western slopes of the brook. On
Saturday afternoon Major Anderson, with the 2nd Battalion,
had received orders to proceed from Courpoil, north
through Beuvardes, and maintain close liaison with the
3rd, which was to go to the river and get contact with the
enemy. Anderson marched his men up to a place north of
the forest of Fere at the southwestern extremity of Villers
sur Fere. Scouts were sent out to examine the ground
toward the river, while the Major and his four Captains
went to the town to interview the French Commander, who
told them that it would be impossible to cross the Ourcq
without artillery preparation, owing to the strong position
held by the enemy. They obtained information about the
dispositions and plans of the 3rd battalion and then returned
to their commands.</p>

<p>About half past three in the morning Lieutenant Colonel
Mitchell came with the information that the attack was to
be made at 5:45 and that they were not to remain in support,
but to advance to the attack at the left of the 3rd
Battalion. Anderson aroused his men and formed them in
the field north of the forest with Companies E and F in
the front line, E being on the right, and G and H behind
them. They advanced in approach formation through the
fields until they reached the southern slope of the crest
just south of the river, where orders were received for the
battalions to halt.</p>

<p>This advance was made under heavy shell fire and at serious
cost. Early in the advance Charles B. Wethered and
William Hurst were killed by the same shell, which also
wounded Haggerty, Dearborn and Strang; and nearer to
the river Company H suffered a tremendous loss by the
severe wounding of Captain James G. Finn, whose leg
was so badly gashed that he had to be carried from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
field. The place where the battalion was to cross was to
the west of the little brook. To their left was Fere en
Tardenois, which was being systematically attacked by the
French troops. Our people had time to admire the method
in which these seasoned warriors went about their business.
They had dug in during the night so that they could
place their fire against three sides of the town, but they
evidently had no intention of going over the river until the
fire of the machine guns had been fairly well blanked. Some
of their men were engaged in drawing fire from the German
nests, while others were sniping at them from their shelters.</p>

<p>Our men got the advantage of the French thoroughness
when, as they came over the crest, they were liberally spattered
with bullets from two or three detached houses on
the left just outside Fere en Tardenois. Our one pounders
were directed at them; but the French gave those hornet’s
nests their <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup de grace</i> when they pulled up one of their
75’s which they had handy, right into the front line and
sent a few shells straight as rifle bullets into the houses.
Captain Kelly sent my old friend, John Finnegan, with a
patrol to see if any of the enemy were left in the houses.
John came back with the report that there were no Germans
there but dead ones.</p>

<p>The battalion rushed down and across the Ourcq without
a casualty. There was one German gun which commanded
the little bridge and which could have caused great losses,
but the gunners were daunted by the resolute advance of
our men, as they knew that no matter how many they
might kill, they could not themselves escape, so they threw
up their hands and surrendered.</p>

<p>Companies E and F rushed over the little bridge and
through the river and up the slope of the hill towards
Seringes and Bois Colas. Here Captain Charles Baker of
Company E was badly wounded in the neck and shoulder,
one of his best Sergeants, Michael Lynch, was killed, and
the bold Steve Derrig got a mortal wound. (Long afterwards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
we learned with deep and universal regret that Captain
Baker died of his wounds.)</p>

<p>Company F on the left had the place of danger, as their
route lay straight up the hill and over the flats, to skirt the
village of Seringes, the village itself being allotted to the
Ohios when they could take their place in the line. Since
they had been unavoidably detained and the French were
still working in their business-like fashion at the task of
getting Fere en Tardenois ready for capture, Kelly’s left
flank was bound to be in the air with the prospects of worse
to come if he got far enough forward to have it pass the
village, which was giving trouble enough while in front.</p>

<p>He sent messengers to Company E on his right to see
whether Bois Colas was rid of the enemy, for if it were
strongly held, his men would be simply fighting down a lane
into a trap. Jim Quigley of Company E had been in there
already and Jim came around to report that the woods was
not held by the Germans. Later Captain Prout sent a party
into the wood and Lieutenant Conners, commanding E
Company, took possession of it up to its northern edge.
Kelly’s men had meanwhile been going forward in spite of
Artillery and Machine Gun fire, until they found a spot
from which they could effectively retaliate. This was a cutting
in the roadway between Fere en Tardenois and the
north edge of Bois Colas. The shelter it gave was not very
great, but Lieutenant Frank Marsh had his automatic and
rifle men lined up in the ditch, happy to get a shot at the
foe that had been sending death amongst them. In the
advance they had lost Frank Connaughton, Charles Fox and
Michael Campbell, and later on Charles Caplinger, Harry
Jennings and John J. McGloin. While holding the road
other good men were killed. Matt Wynne, who was known
to the whole regiment; Frank Divine, Lawrence Brennan,
Alfred O’Neill, Sergeant Thomas Erb and Eugene Doty
were mortally wounded, and also Harry Mansfield and
Charles Melsa.</p>

<p>Kelly with his headquarters group, 1st Sergeant Joseph<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
Blake, Sergeant John P. Mahon, Corporals Long and Finnegan,
Harris and McLean and also Lieutenant Ogle had
his post at the crest of the hill where he could watch the
fortunes of his forward detachment. Finding them hard
pressed he got two automatics from the Ohios, who had
now crossed the river and were forming under the bank,
and sent Long and Finnegan for reinforcements from his
own Battalion. Colonel Anderson ordered them sent, and
detachments from all three Companies proceeded through
Bois Colas and started working forward to support the
right flank of the F Company men. In this operation
Company E lost Thomas Cullen, Philip Ford, Edward
Fuld, Frank O’Meara, Louis Hazelton, Louis Cohen, John
Costello, Michael Breen, Emmett Bingham, Corporal Gus
Winter (hit carrying Cullen in), and Corporal John Cronin,
the saint of the Company (who had gone as a volunteer),
and whose body lay when I came to bury him the nearest to
the enemy of any soldier of ours. Not far from Cronin’s
body lay four men of Company H, John T. McCarthy, Patrick
Reynolds, George Smith and Thomas Hayes. G Company
lost John Conroy, Floyd Graham, and Edmund Reardon.
Patrick Scanlan, whose brother Dan I had buried
at Baccarat, was wounded this day, but stuck to his Company
to meet his death the day following, as did James
Higgins of the same Company. Of the two guides from
Company F, Long was wounded and the heroic John Finnegan
fought his last fight.</p>

<p>It was evident to anybody that a further advance without
careful artillery preparation was impossible. Like the
3rd Battalion on the other hill across this valley, they had
reached the level approach to the strong defenses in the
village and along the southern edge of the forest. It was
an artillery job. And any infantry commander who would
send his men across that open space would deserve a court
martial. The difficulty for both battalions arose from the
alacrity with which they had obeyed the orders from above
which sent them across the Ourcq on a bayonet charge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
against a fleeing foe. They had followed the orders, and
overcoming the first resistance of the enemy, they found
themselves opposed to the main line of defense with practically
nobody else, French or American, on their side of
the river. Their flanks unsupported, to go forward would
be to hand the Germans a couple of geese to pluck, and as
there were no means of communication with the distant artillery
except runners, that arm of the service could not
act without grave danger of shooting up its own side.</p>

<p>The Ohios meanwhile had pushed their way up to have
their share in the battle. But since they had been considered
as a support regiment, they naturally thought they were
coming to relieve the New Yorkers, and officers and men
announced that supposed fact to the groups of our men.
Anderson stormed around when he heard of it and Kelly
and Prout were disgusted, but they finally accepted the
situation of falling back into a support position when orders
came to make it final. After their struggles in the battle
less than two weeks before the second battalion deserved a
comparative rest from the toil of fighting. They withdrew
to the northern edge of the Ourcq, where they supported
the advance of the 1st Battalion the next day. Later the
same day they formed a connecting link with the Alabamas
on our right. The losses of the battalion in the remaining
days of the fight were few in comparison. John McGeary
of G was killed while saving the wounded of Company H.
Sergeant James P. Robinson and Thomas Bugler were
killed by shell fire and also Arthur Baia of Company E.
On July 30th, while providing for the needs of men in line,
two Sergeants of Company F, Charles Denon and Charles
D. Echeverria, were killed, and Lieutenant Smith and
Thomas Kelleher of the same company seriously wounded.
While engaged in a similar task the First Sergeant of Company
H, Daniel O’Neill, whose brother, William, had been
killed in Champagne, was mortally wounded, leaving only
one of that famous trio still alive.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i_181.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">THE BATTLE FIELD OF THE OURCQ</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It was between nine and ten in the morning that Major<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
Donovan’s battalion had reached the river, and not long
after midday the relief of the 3rd Battalion was practically
complete. Major Donovan brought into line with him
three Companies, A, B and C. Company D, which had been
on the hill since early morning, was told that it could retire
with the 3rd Battalion. It had suffered losses, though not
so severe as the other companies. The platoons on the left
of the line had occupied Meurcy Farm with Company K.
On the right the headquarters group and one platoon under
Lieutenants Connelly and Daly had performed a very neat
job of infiltration. There was a group of German machine
guns in a clump of trees some distance beyond the right
flank of our battalion, which was exceedingly annoying. So
Connelly took his detachment far to the right, shielded by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
the bank of the river road, and led them up a gully into
the rear of the Germans, driving them out by rifle fire and
hand grenades. Two of his men, James Hayes and Harry
Silver, an automatic rifle team, occupied a lone outpost
which was attacked by the enemy. Silver was mortally hit,
but kept on working his rifle till it dropped from his
hands. Hayes grasped it and kept up the fight till he was
wounded and taken prisoner.</p>

<p>In spite of their hard day, Company D wished to remain
in the fight with their own battalion. Connelly and Daly
represented this to the Major, who was very glad to keep
them.</p>

<p>Major Donovan did not try to retain occupation of all
the hill, since the results of the gallant work of the preceding
battalion were preserved if the German machine guns
could be prevented from re-establishing their posts on it.
So he placed automatic riflemen and sharp-shooters in the
wheatfield, and drew up the main body of his troops under
the lea of the high inner bank of the river road, the one
under which McKenna’s Battalion had formed for their attack.
The Alabamas were under the same bank further to
the right, while Anderson’s men held the river bank and
the wooded swampy ground across the valley to the left,
keeping in touch with the Ohios, who were also along the
river.</p>

<p>The afternoon and night passed without any special infantry
action. When the strength of the enemy resistance
became manifest, the artillery were put to work. Both
regiments of our divisional light artillery were given to
the 83rd Infantry Brigade: The 151st (Minnesota) behind
us and the 149th (Illinois) behind the Ohios. Further back
our heavies, the 150th (Indiana) and Corps Artillery were
sending their huge missiles over our heads at the enemy’s
position. The edges of the forest of Nesles and the roads
behind were heavily shelled. This led the enemy to a great
deal of counter-battery work, and the infantry had it easier.
But their shelters were exposed at all times to machine gun<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
fire and it was dangerous for a man to lift up his head.
Companies B and C successively held the hill slope and had
many casualties. Captain Reilley was wounded, but kept
right on till the whole battle was over. Tommy Mooney
was hit four times and came off the hill joking with his
friends, who had so often said that he was too thin for a
German to hit him. B Company lost good men in James
Phillips, William Doyle, Michael Tierney, Joseph Chambers,
John A. Lane and Thomas Kelley. That night, too,
Barney Barry, soldier and saint, pulled the latchstrings of
the gate of Paradise. From C Company also Mat Carberry
and Richard Dieringer, Joe Augustine and John O’Connor,
good lads all and true, received their mortal wounds and
John J. Campbell and John F. Autry, litter bearers of Company
A, were killed while performing their work of mercy.</p>

<p>By morning the plans were made for a new alignment
for attack. The 165th Infantry was to sweep the valley
along both sides of the brook, with Bois Colas on the left
of it, and Meurcy Farm on the right, as their immediate
objectives. The second battalion was to be in close support.
Further left, the Ohios were to advance on the right of the
French and occupy the Village of Seringes et Nesles. The
movement of the 84th Brigade was co-ordinated with the
advance of the 83rd.</p>

<p>This called for a shifting of Donovan’s battalion to the
left, to face up the valley. The movement was carried out
in the early morning of Monday, July 29th, with few losses,
but one of them a costly one. Lieutenant Daly, thinking as
usual of the safety of his men, and paying little attention
to himself, was killed. Well, as Lieutenant Burke had said
of him two days before, there was no place else he would
rather be. His sacrifice was made with a generous heart.</p>

<p>The Battalion was lined up in the following order. Right
of the brook, Company A, with Lieutenant Baldwin in the
lead, and Company B in support, under Captain Reilley,
their mission being to debouch from the scattered trees
which concealed them, and advance up the gentle slope<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
forward and right to Meurcy Farm. On the left, Company
C, under Captain Bootz, had the van, with Company D,
under Lieutenant Connelly, in support. Their work was to
push on to the left of the brook and clean up Bois Colas,
a thickly wooded clump of trees about as big as three
city blocks, which lay two hundred yards west of the
farm.</p>

<p>Company A had only one officer with them in the attack
as Lieutenant D’Aguerro, with Sergeants Duff and Schmidt,
had charge of a platoon whose duty it was to carry ammunition.
Lieutenant Baldwin, an earnest, courageous
man, was in command, with Sergeant Thomas J. Sweeney
as First Sergeant. They advanced at eight o’clock in the
morning and were immediately made to feel that they
were in for a hard time. There were German machine guns
now in Meurcy Farm and on both sides of it. The shelling,
too, was vigorous, as all their motions could be seen and
reported. Sergeants Fred Garretson and Don Matthews
led a detachment with great prudence and dexterity, capturing
one of the machine gun nests and seven prisoners.
The direct attack against the farm, however, was not to be
successful that day. Sergeant Scully, who had been badly
wounded in the Lunéville raid, was wounded again early in
the fight. Acting Sergeant Willie Mehl, whose father used
to bring him to our encampment as a lad, was also hit;
and many another good man was put out of action forever.
Corporal Petersilze was killed and Corporal Michael O’Sullivan,
a big, bright, good-natured giant, whom I had held in
my arms as a baby, and another of the Campbells of Company
A, Louis, this time, slender Harry Kane and sturdy
Dan O’Connell, Stephen Curtin, who did good work
with his automatic; James Ronan, Leroy Hanover,
Joseph P. Myers, James Robinson, John Gray, John
Williams, Clyde Evans, John Boneslawski, William Barton,
John Gilluly, John Rice, William Thompson, W. V. Kelley,
John Fisher, Dennis Donovan, Fred Floar, William Mallin,
were killed on the field. Fred Finger was killed going back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
with the wounded. Tom Fleming and Charles Mack died
in the dressing station, and Anthony Michaels, Albert Poole,
James Tiffany, Patrick Carlisle and Edward Blanchard died
of wounds in the hospital.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Baldwin was in the van waving his pistol,
when a machine gun bullet struck him in the chest. His
last words were: “Sergeant (to Sweeney), carry out the
orders!” His spirit animated the brave men who followed.
Moreover, they had still a fine leader in Tom Sweeney, and
they kept pushing ahead, some of them meeting their fate
under the very walls of the farm. It was all that they
could do. One officer and twenty-five men of the diminished
company were killed that morning. Multiply the
deaths by six to get the total casualties and one can see
that few indeed were left. Sergeant Sweeney ordered his
men to dig in and wait. They were still full of spirit
and vigor. Major Donovan tells of the impression made
on him by a New York High School boy who carried his
messages under fire with a cigarette nonchalantly drooping
from his lip, coming and going as if he were an A. D. T.
messenger on Broadway. It was Harold Henderson. Ed.
Chamberlain, whom I had always admired, also did credit
to the good opinion of his friends. He was hit across the
stomach and as he rose to go back, holding the ripped
edges together to keep his bowels from falling out, he said
to Sweeney: “Have you any messages for the rear?”</p>

<p>It was some hours after Lieutenant Baldwin’s death that
Lieutenant Henry Kelley arrived with Major Donovan’s
orders to assume command. “Hec” Kelley, a young lawyer
who enlisted as a private in B Company when we went to
the Border, was never one to take good care of himself
in a fight. He lasted just half an hour and was carried back
with a bad wound which robbed us of his hearty, courageous
presence for the rest of the war. Sweeney and the rest
stuck it out till morning. Corporal John F. Dennelly, who
had left his country newspaper in Long Island to join
the 69th, spent the night with an outpost which was busy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
discouraging the nocturnal efforts of the Germans to erect
barbed wire defenses in front of the farm.</p>

<p>In the morning the remnants of Company A withdrew a
slight distance down the valley to merge with Company
B. This Company, too, had had its losses. One platoon,
under Lieutenant Wheatley, was in line with Company A,
and the rest of them were close behind. Lieutenant Wheatley
met the usual fate of officers in this battle by being
wounded. Timothy McCarthy, Denis Bagley and Albert
Lambert were killed and Phil Schron died at the dressing-station.
It was a pleasant surprise to everybody in the
Company that their gigantic captain, Tom Reilley, was not
hit again, as he walked around using a rifle for a crutch
and exposing his massive frame to the enemy. But he escaped
with no further wounds.</p>

<p>Company A failed to get the farm that day, but their
dogged persistence helped to make the task of Company C
an easier one. This Company was led by Captain Bootz
with Lieutenants Irving, Allen, Betty, Stone and Friedlander.
They advanced with their right near to the brook
and their left on the slope of the hill towards Seringes. A
machine gun on the south edge of Bois Colas hampered
them, but they got up one of our guns with Lieutenant Davis
and Sergeant John O’Leary and soon put it out of action.
When they got to the woods they beat their way through
them cautiously, expecting every moment to find resistance,
but they met only one frightened German who was glad
when they made him prisoner. From the other side they
could see a disconcerted enemy dotting the slopes in front of
the forest of Nesles. The riflemen immediately got busy
and when Lieutenants Davis and Bell came up with the
machine guns, commanded by Captain Seibert, the field gray
uniforms disappeared under their fire.</p>

<p>The first platoon, under Lieutenant Allen, had harder
going. Its task was to cover the left flank as the line advanced,
which brought the men along the top of the hill,
where they suffered severely. Sergeant Crittenden was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
killed and Louis Torrey, a pious lad, Charles Geary also,
and Carlton Ellis and R. J. Schwartz. Sergeant Dan Garvey
and Frank Daley, John J. Murphy, Patrick Cronin and one
of the Gordon brothers were fatally wounded and carried
off the field. Harry McAllister was badly wounded. Big,
impulsive Mike Cooney carried him down through a rain of
fire to the bottom and then went back through it to get
his rifle. James Allen lay out on the hill moaning. Harry
Horgan started up to get him but was killed before reaching
him. Thomas O’Connor crept up cautiously and coolly.
He was stooping to pick him up when a bullet struck him
and he fell on the body of his comrade. Nothing daunted,
Michael Ruane and William McCarthy made their way up
that hill of death and carried down their wounded comrade.
Both Allen and McAllister afterwards died of their wounds.</p>

<p>The biggest price paid for the capture of Bois Colas was
when the courageous soldier and trusted leader, Captain
Henry Bootz, was put out of action by a bullet which
passed through his chest from side to side. He had a wound
which would have killed an ordinary man, but he merely
grinned, took his pipe which he used in action to signal to
his men and threw it to Lieutenant Betty, saying: “Here,
son, I won’t need this for a while.” He started back, followed
by his faithful orderly, Michael Sypoula, better
known as “Zip,” who had gotten a wound himself and was
happy that he had a reason for sticking to his beloved Captain.
First Sergeant Gene Halpin and Maguire assisted
Captain Bootz to the rear. Lieutenant Friedlander had also
received a dangerous face wound and had been carried off
the field by Austin McSweeney of the Headquarters Company.</p>

<p>Major Donovan, never happy unless in the middle of
things, had gone up the bed of the brook so as to keep
ahead of the advance of C on the left and A on the right.
Lieutenant Ames, his Adjutant, was with him, led by devotion
as well as duty, for the Major was his ideal leader.
They lay half in the brook, resting on the bank, when a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
sniper’s bullet from the farm yard whizzed past Donovan’s
ear and struck Ames in the head, liberating for larger
purposes a singularly attractive and chivalrous soul.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Connelly tells of coming up with Sergeant
Tom O’Malley and Corporal Gribbon to receive orders from
the Major about taking over the line from Company C.
He did not know just where to find him until he met Bootz
going down the brook bed with his faithful attendants.
Following up the stream he found Donovan still in the
water with Ames’s body by his side. The Major also had
received a bullet wound in the hand. Nearby, Pete Gillespie,
whose machine gun was out of order, was absorbed
in the game of getting the sniper who had killed the Lieutenant.
All stopped to watch him and his rifle. Pete settled
down, intent on a dead horse near the farm. Suddenly
he saw something had moved behind it. He cuddled his
rifle, waited and fired. They could see the sniper behind
the horse half rise, then drop. The beloved Lieutenant was
avenged.</p>

<p>The day’s work had improved the situation immensely.
Control of Bois Colas gave a better command of the terrain
northwards to the edge of the forest, although Bois
Brulé, a narrow strip of woods which lay between, was still
alive with machine guns. Meurcy Farm was not yet occupied,
but its capacity for being troublesome was reduced by
its being outflanked by our left. Anderson’s battalion held
the lower slopes of the hill that had been taken by the third
battalion the first day, and kept the Germans from reoccupying
it permanently. Anderson was in touch with the
84th Brigade which was on the same line with himself.
The Iowas and part of the Alabamas had taken the town
of Sergy. It was a tough nut to crack, and took all the
dash of the Southerners and the stubborn persistence of
the Westerners to conquer and hold it. The elements of
the regiment on our immediate right delayed their advance
until the whole brigade was in a position to move
forward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span></p>

<p>The other regiment in our Brigade made a fine advance
on our left. The 2nd Battalion passed through the first, and
after our regiment had taken Bois Colas, the Ohios could
be seen pushing up to the road running from Fere en Tardenois
to Meurcy Farm. To co-operate with them Major
Donovan sent Lieutenant Betty with what was left of
Company C (sixty-five men) to move with their flank,
Company D holding Bois Colas with forty-two men. The
Ohios kept advancing and by nightfall had captured the
southern half of Seringes et Nesles. The upper portion
which curved over to the top of our valley was not occupied
until the German retreat had begun.</p>

<p>The situation was set for a further advance. Headquarters
at regiment, brigade, and division were busy preparing
for it and the Artillery were ready to co-operate. They
had been shelling Bois Brulé just in front of us, and the
upper edge of Seringes et Nesles and the edge of the forest
all day. Telephone lines had been stretched to the front
by the 117th Signal Battalion and our own signal section of
Headquarters Company.</p>

<p>These were exceedingly busy days at Colonel McCoy’s
P. C., for at last there was a spot that one could dignify
with the title of Post of Command. The first day of the
battle there had been three or four posts in succession. On
Saturday evening Colonel McCoy was in the Chateau de
Fere, but when he got orders for his regiment to make
the attack he went forward with them himself to join McKenna
near the river. When the battalion went over he
set up his headquarters right there in a shallow trench on
the exposed river slope. It seemed no place for a commanding
officer on whom so much had to depend, but he
made up his mind that it was his place to be where he could
view the battle himself, as there was no speedy way for him
to get information, and the immediate decision concerning
the actions and fate of his men would rest largely on his
own judgment. These were his reasons; but there is always
a good deal of the element of personality back of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
anybody’s reasons. And Frank R. McCoy, soldier of five
campaigns, would naturally see the force of reasons which
brought him as close as possible to the firing line. The
Germans began to argue the point in their usual violent
way, but the Colonel remained unconvinced.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Rerat was wounded slightly in that hole, and
many men hurt around it. Finally Captain Hurley was
badly wounded while reporting to his Chief, and the Staff
united with the Germans in arguing that it was not the
best place to do regimental business. So Colonel McCoy
brought them back a ways to a sunken road that ran across
the town. Here the shelling pursued them and Lieutenant
B. B. Kane, a fine, manly fellow, received a mortal wound
from a shell that exploded a few feet from where he was
standing in a group around the Colonel.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the reliable Captain Michael J. Walsh had
been scouring the town for a suitable place, and had found
one in the cellar of a house still nearer the lines, but accessible
to messengers from the orchards on the east, thus
obviating the trip through Dead Man’s Curve.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 29th Colonel McCoy with Lieutenant
Colonel Mitchell went up to look over the whole situation
and consult with Donovan and Anderson. The decks
were now cleared for a battle. The telephone was in to the
front line, to the Brigade Post of Command, and to the
Artillery. There was a chance for a commanding officer
to be of real service to the Battalion Commanders. With
the telephone to the front and rear at his elbow, he had
the strings in his hands, and he certainly kept pulling those
strings day and night. A message would come in from an
O. P. (Observation Post) where Captain Elmer and Corporal
Bob Lee were on the watch: “Shells needed on machine
gun nests at crest of hill 195.45-274.05 to 196.1-274.5.”
Or one from Donovan: “Important to shell Bois
Brulé, where forty machine gun emplacements are reported.”
And Lieutenant Weaver, a smart youngster from
the 151st Field Artillery, would be put on the job in a second.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
Or it might be a message of the Colonel to General
Lenihan in response to a call from Donovan: “Cut out fire
on neck of woods south of Bois Brulé. It is endangering
our Infantry in Bois Colas.” Night and day that telephone
was working, receiving news from the front, effecting
co-operation with neighboring regiments or sending
back requests for barrages, counter-battery work, food supplies,
ammunition, ambulances, air service. Soldiers in the
line never fully realize how much their lives, and victory,
which is more to them than their lives, depend on the alertness
and intelligence of those in command.</p>

<p>It was an interesting group at the regimental P. C.,
McCoy with his spare soldierly figure and his keen soldierly
face, radiant with the joy of action and the prospects
of victory, always a stimulus to those who might be downhearted.
For the first day, as operations officer, he had
George McAdie, patient, painstaking and enduring, until the
order came, less endurable to him than an enemy bullet, that
he should proceed forthwith for duty at a home station.
A hard sentence for a born soldier in the middle of a battle.
And succeeding him Merle-Smith, just come out of the carnage,
with an untidy bandage around his wounded arm, but
with his mind set only on his job. Alert youngsters, Lieutenants
Rerat, Seidelman, Jim Mangan, Heinel (afterwards
wounded) and Preston, with Captain Jack Mangan drifting
in occasionally to see if his supplies were coming up satisfactorily.</p>

<p>And next to the Colonel was one big personality dominating
all; the rugged personality of Captain Michael J. Walsh,
old soldier and solid man. He was disgusted with his part
in the conflict. “I came out here to be a soldier and I am
nothing but a damn room orderly,” he growled. But who
fed the hungry fighting men? Captain Michael Walsh.
Who scoured the yards of houses for utensils to send up
the food to them? Captain Michael Walsh. Who saw
that the ammunition was delivered on time to the front
line. Once more, Captain Walsh. And the Colonel, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
there was a task of real importance to perform, never
delegated it to the bright young men; he always said: “Captain
Walsh will attend to that.”</p>

<p>The principal task for July 30th was assigned to the
84th Brigade. They were to try to get forward and even up
the line on our right. The Ohios were to hold fast, but
Donovan requested to take advantage of the forward movement
on the right to improve our position with reference
to Bois Brulé. Company C was still in line west of Bois
Colas maintaining our connection with the Ohios. Company
D was at the upper edge of this woods with the machine
gunners under Captain Seibert, Lieutenants Doris,
Davis and Bell. Companies B and A were dug in around
the approaches to the farm. Food came up on the night of
the 29th for the first time. The men were all hungry, as
their reserve rations had been consumed long before. Lieutenant
Springer had been sent to take command of Company
A, succeeding Lieutenant D’Aguerro, who had been
wounded in his turn. He and his First Sergeant, Tom
Sweeney, were sitting on the edge of a hole preparing to enjoy
a can of corn when one bullet got both of them. They
were helped back to the dressing station and Sergeant Higginson
took command. The affair had its compensations.
Higginson and young Henderson got the corn.</p>

<p>Major Donovan’s Post of Command was a hole at the
southern edge of Bois Colas. Lieutenant Ames’ body had
been brought in during the night and buried nearby. Ames’
place as battalion adjutant was filled by Sergeant Joyce
Kilmer, whose position as Sergeant of the Intelligence Section
would naturally have entitled him to a place nearer
regimental headquarters. But he had preferred to be with
a battalion in the field and had chosen Donovan’s. The
Major placed great reliance on his coolness and intelligence
and kept him by his side. That suited Joyce, for to be at
Major Donovan’s side in a battle is to be in the center of
activity and in the post of danger. To be in a battle, a
battle for a cause that had his full devotion, with the regiment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
he loved, under a leader he admired, that was living at
the top of his being. On the morning of the 30th Major
Donovan went forward through the woods to look over the
position. Kilmer followed, unbidden. He lay at the north
edge of the woods looking out towards the enemy. The
Major went ahead, but Kilmer did not follow. Donovan
returned and found him dead. A bullet had pierced his
brain. His body was carried in and buried by the side of
Ames. God rest his dear and gallant soul.</p>

<p>At 3:30 that afternoon the 84th Brigade had made progress,
though it was slow and difficult going. The artillery
was doing good work but all their efforts could not keep
down the fire of the German Machine Gunners. The gratifying
surprise of the day was when two escadrilles of
friendly planes came over. Our companies in the line had
not been pushed very hard. They repelled a couple of
counter attacks on their position, and the machine gunners
were on the alert to fire whenever our artillery work on
Bois Bruleé started the Germans running.</p>

<p>Donovan was to move forward when the progress of
the 84th Brigade brought them abreast of him. But regiments,
brigades, and it was said, divisions, sloped away to
the right like steps of stairs, and each was hanging back for
the others to come up. So Major Donovan insisted on
making a try for Bois Brulé without waiting for any
help except what our Brigade would give. Colonel Hough
was perfectly willing to back him up. So Lieutenant Connelly
with Company D moved out to the attack.</p>

<p>It was the pitiful remnant of a company, one officer and
forty-two men instead of the six officers and two hundred
and fifty men who formerly swung along like an old time
battalion in the parades on the Hempstead Plains. But
the few who were left were inured to danger by patrols
and raids and battles, and they were ready for anything.
The ground in front was rough and hummocky for two
hundred yards, and then a double row of trees led up to the
Bois Brulé. At the right it sloped off to the brook where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
it ran past Meurcy Farm. Sergeant Dick O’Neill was to
cover the ground in front with fifteen men, including Masterson,
Peterson, Bedient, Gugliere, McGee, McAree, Stoddard,
Lord, and Edward Moran.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Cook led a smaller number of picked men to
work to the right and up the bed of the brook, cooperating
with Companies A and B working around the farm. In
his command were John Gribbon, his red head an oriflamme
of war; Colton Bingham, the fighting nephew of the gentle
Bishop of Buffalo, John Curtin, a tall young Irishman who
afterwards became regimental standard bearer, Tommy
Blake, later Lieutenant Blake, and the steadiest of riflemen,
Pat McDonough. Lieutenant Connelly came in the rear of
his skirmish line where he could control their movements.
With him were his First Sergeants Edward Geaney, Sergeant
Hubert Murray, Corporal John F. Moran and others.
Tom O’Malley had already been wounded.</p>

<p>Some distance out there was a deep, irregular sand pit.
O’Neill, carefully rounding the corner of it, suddenly saw
right under his eyes a body of about 25 Germans. He
uttered a shout of warning and jumped into the midst of
them with his pistol cracking. He had shot down three Germans
before they realized what was happening, and produced
great confusion amongst them. Some rushed to the
other side of the pit while others began firing at O’Neill,
who kept firing after he was hit, and when finally carried
back to the dressing station had seven bullets in him. The
Germans who had run across the sand pit found themselves
face to face with Lieutenant Connelly and his little group.
What followed was as sudden, as confused in plan, and as
resolute in spirit as the action around the log house in
Stevenson’s Treasure Island. The Company D men came
running from all sides to take part in the fighting. On our
side Connelly was hit; also Geaney, Gribbon and McDonough.
And James J. Gugliere, Paul McGee, Louis Peterson
and Rollie Bedient were killed. This all happened in an instant.
The Germans paid a fearful price for it. Those that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
were left scrambled out of the pit to flee in the direction of
their own forces. There they saw the advance elements of
O’Neill’s section running back toward them, and they turned
toward Bois Colas at a headlong gait. The cry went up
that a counter attack was coming. Colonel Hough saw it
and telephoned to our headquarters. Anderson heard back
in the woods and stormed up from the support with reinforcements.
Our machine guns were turned on the advancing
Germans; and the advent of a few bedraggled prisoners
in dirty field gray uniforms let the rear line see that
the counter-attack was a myth. The whole business was
over in a few minutes.</p>

<p>But the Germans in Bois Brulé were again at work
sweeping the ground with their bullets and it was under
fierce fire that John Burke, Joe Lynch, McAuliffe, Bingham
and Blake carried in Lieutenant Connelly and the other
wounded. Sergeant Murray took command and kept the
survivors going forward until they had outposts established
in the approaches to Bois Brulé.</p>

<p>Besides those already mentioned, Company D lost, killed
in these three days, Corporal Frank Fall, Privates George
Johnson, Terance McAree, John McCormick, Michael Romanuk,
Harvey J. Venneman, Robert Luff, Frank J. Lackner,
Attilio Manfredi, Edward G. Coxe, John Dolan and the
senior of the two Michael J. Sheas, who died of his wounds.</p>

<p>July 31st was a day of comparative quiet. The longer
the struggle lasted the more it was borne in upon the Lords
of High Decision that the ousting of the enemy from their
position was a matter for artillery. It was the first time
we had the opportunity to observe with reluctant admiration
the German development of the use of the machine gun in
defensive warfare. To send infantry in under the intense
fire of their numerous guns was like feeding paper to a
flame. Our artillery, however, was good,—none better
in the whole war, we confidently assert, and we waited with
assurance for them to reduce the resistance. If our air service
were sufficiently developed to give them good photographs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
of positions, and to register their fire, we felt sure
that the Infantry would soon be in a position to make short
work of enemy opposition.</p>

<p>That day we had our first experience of another auxiliary
arm. The day before there landed at the regimental P. C.
a section of our 30th Engineers, our Gas and Flame regiment.
With them there was an Australian officer with a
name that would qualify him for the 69th, and a young
lieutenant who, we discovered after he was killed, was a son
of the famous baseball manager, Ned Hanlan of Baltimore.
They came out with their men on the 31st and threw over
thermite and smoke bombs on Bois Brulé and Meurcy Farm.
Under their protection Company D occupied the woods.</p>

<p>Company A, under Lieutenant Stone, finally took possession
of the Farm. The first attempt failed. A patrol
led by Corporal Sidney Clark started up but four men were
hit in the first three minutes, Michaels dying of his wounds.
Another attempt was made in the evening and the farm
was occupied by a patrol under Corporals John Dennelly
and Van Arsdale.</p>

<p>It was evident that the enemy’s resistance was weakening
and that it would be a matter of a very short period
before he would retreat to his next line of defence. On
August 1st the 3rd Battalion relieved the 1st in line. Company
M had had serious losses after being drawn out from
the line on July 28th, as the battalion had been bombed
in its reserve position at the sunken road, and the Company
had suffered other losses in a ration detail which was caught
out under a heavy fire. Of its officers, Lieutenant Hunt
Warner was badly wounded; Lieutenant Collier was
wounded but stuck to his post. Edward Brennan, Hugh
Kaiser, Alfred Schneider and Johnnie Madden were killed
and Sergeant Nicholson wounded. Captain Meaney and
Lieutenants McIntyre and Bunnell escaped uninjured. Lieutenant
McIntyre was blown into the Ourcq by the concussion
of a shell, but he stuck to his task till he finished it.</p>

<p>Company K also suffered further disaster while in reserve,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
and Sergeants Peter Crotty and Bernard McElroy,
who had done prodigious deeds in action, received mortal
wounds; and also William Bergen, who did more work
as a stretcher bearer than any other man I have ever seen
in a battle. Louis Gilbert and Everett Seymour of Company
L were killed in the same bombardment and Sam Klosenberg
fatally wounded.</p>

<p>In fact, the town of Villers sur Fere was throughout the
action a part of the battlefield. Its church square at the
northern end was not more than a thousand yards from
the place of actual conflict. The front line forces were at
times too near each other to allow artillery fire from either
side, as each side had to avoid the danger of shelling its
own infantry—an event which is always most disastrous to
the morale of troops. But the approaches to Villers sur
Fere lay under the eyes of the enemy, and they could see
a constant stream of liaison men, litter bearers, hobbling
wounded, and food and ammunition carriers going in by the
entrance to its one street. They knew it to be the center
of our web so they very wisely concentrated most of their
fire upon it and especially on the square which opened out
after the short narrow northern entrance of Dead Man’s
Curve. Even before dawn they had been raking its streets
as a natural mode of approach of an oncoming enemy, killing
and wounding a large number of men. Indeed nearly
one-third of those who lost their lives in this action received
their death wounds from shell fire in and around
Villers sur Fere.</p>

<p>Early in the morning of July 28th, Lieutenant Joseph J.
Kilcourse, Medical Officer attached to the Third Battalion,
had opened his aid post in the schoolhouse facing on the
square, and the development of the battle soon made it the
regimental dressing station. The schoolhouse quickly
filled up with wounded. A constant stream of limping men,
of men with bandages around their heads or with arms
carried in rough slings, of men borne on rude litters, were
coming into town along the narrow entrance. No ambulances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
had gotten through and there were no directions as
to where a <em>triage</em> could be found. The courtyard in front
of the hospital was filled with “walking cases,” discussing
the battle with that cheerfulness which is always characteristic
of soldiers who are not fatally wounded. A menacing
whiz came through the air and a shell fell amongst them,
followed by two others, one of which struck the wall and
spattered the litter cases with plaster and broken bricks.
The survivors in the yard scattered in all directions but
nine of them lay quivering or motionless. Lieutenant Kilcourse
ran out sobbing and swearing and working like mad
to save his patients from further harm. Those who could
walk were started down the road towards the Château de
Foret in the hope of being picked up by an ambulance or
truck. Inside the hospital nobody was seriously hurt, but
the men of the Sanitary Detachment labored energetically to
get them into places of comparative safety. These were
Sergeant 1st Class William Helgers, James Mason, James
McCormack, Ferraro, Planeta, Larsen and Daly.</p>

<p>Before long, Lieutenants Lyttle, Martin, Mitchell and
Lawrence had arrived, and the wounded received all the
attention they could be given with the facilities at hand.
But the worst cases lay there till the next morning before
they could be evacuated. They bore their sufferings with
cheerful fortitude, their thoughts being for others. Father
Hanley was sore because he had been put out so soon. Sergeant
John Donahue’s thoughts were with his beloved
Company L; Tommy Delaney, an innocent lovable boy,
talked of his mother and what a good son to her he had
planned to be if he had lived, and Tom Mansfield, with his
leg shattered, was full of Irish pride that he had been given
a chance to be in a big battle with the “Ould Rigiment.”</p>

<p>Headquarters Company was located in town in the shattered
houses and stables but most of its sections had to
take a frequent part in field operations. The signal section,
under Lieutenant James Mangan, labored at great risk in
putting down the wires for connection with the front line<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
on the night of July 28th. Sergeant Beall, Corporal Brochen
and Privates J. McCabe, Kirwin and Olson kept the
lines intact, while the remainder of the platoon did great
service as ammunition bearers. The intelligence section
under Captain Elmer had an observation post 100 yards
northwest of Villers sur Fere which did excellent work in
reporting machine gun nests and the direction of fire of
enemy artillery. Dick Larned acted as Chief of Scouts with
the Third Battalion and Joyce Kilmer and Levinson with
the First Battalion. In the headquarters section little Corporal
Malone was on the job day and night with his runners.
Edward Mulligan of this section was killed.</p>

<p>Coming to what we might call the Infantry Artillery, the
Stokes mortar platoon rendered excellent service throughout
the battle. Two sections of this platoon under Sergeants
Jaeger and Fitzsimmons took up the advance with
the Infantry on July 27th. Early Sunday morning, July
28th, an infantry patrol drew fire from enemy machine guns
located on the banks of the Ourcq river. Major McKenna
called for one trench mortar, and a gun crew in charge of
Sergeant Fitzsimmons and Corporal Harvey reported and
shelled the enemy position in front of the Ourcq. At three
in the morning Colonel McCoy ordered a barrage to be
fired by the four guns on a machine gun nest. This was
done and then the men waited for the advance of the Infantry
at 4:30. When the first wave started to cross the
Ourcq a barrage was laid down until the troops had crossed
the river and were ascending the height beyond it. The
men then followed the advance as far as the river when
they were ordered back to their position of reserve in the
village. It was during this advance that John Perry, a fine
youth, received the wound which later caused his death.</p>

<p>On July 29th, one section under Lieutenant Frank McNamara
and Sergeant Cudmore, entered the lines to support
the first battalion. This section fired an effective barrage
when the enemy attempted a counter-attack. During
this action Private Malcolm Robertson was killed by an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
enemy shell and Sergeant Cudmore and F. Garvey were
wounded. On August 1st at two in the afternoon one gun
was set up in front of the woods facing Meurcy Farm.
Despite the fact that enemy aeroplanes constantly harassed
them, machine gun nests in and about Meurcy Farm were
shelled with good results. After two hours work the men
were driven to cover by enemy machine guns, Corporal
Clark and Private Casey receiving severe wounds. The
platoon was relieved on August 2nd and lent their aid to the
burying of the dead.</p>

<p>The 37 mm. guns, commonly known as the one-pounders
did excellent work, the small platoon paying a heavy
price in losses. On July 28th, three members of the crew
were killed with one shell in the village square as they were
advancing with their gun—Cornelius Grauer, Joseph
Becker, Frank Guida—Grauer, a youngster of seventeen,
being a particular favorite with everybody that knew him.
On July 30th the platoon took part in the attack on Meurcy
Farm. During the operations the crew were caught in a
box barrage by the enemy artillery and serious wounds were
sustained by Sergeant Willemin, who was in command, and
Privates Monohan, B. J. McLaughlin, John Seifried and
John Kelly. Although the crew was almost entirely wiped
out, the gun was kept in action by Corporal Charlie Lester
and Private Berry. Another gun crew under command of
Lieutenant Joseph O’Donohue was kept going all morning
and did great execution. Of this crew John C. McLaughlin
was killed while firing his gun.</p>

<p>The members of the Company whose duties detained
them in the village worked for the interest of the whole
regiment in positions almost equally exposed with those
in the front line. Captain Walsh, a soldier of many campaigns,
knew what the men in line needed was not encouragement
(he took it for granted that every man had courage)
nor sympathy (his own feeling was one of envy of
them), but ammunition and food. His own company kitchen
worked night and day to feed everybody who came into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
town on any business. Mess Sergeant Louis Goldstein and
Cooks John Wilker and Leo Maher, moved by his example,
set up their kitchen under an arch just off the square and
fed 800 men a day while the engagement lasted.</p>

<p>That square was an interesting sight throughout the battle.
Men drifted in, singly or in twos or in parties, fresh
from scenes of death. Liaison men, ammunition details, litter
bearers carrying stretchers dripping blood. They were
fresh from the field where bullets were flying. They had
been forced to drop on their faces as they crossed the valley
under fire. They had scurried around Dead Man’s
Curve and they were still only about 1,000 yards from the
fighting, with shells still screaming in the air above their
heads and enemy planes forcing them to scuttle out of
sight, but they were not breathless or anxious or excited.
They borrowed the “makings,” or got a cup of coffee from
John Wilker and stole a few minutes to gossip about the
fight or to relate something that struck them as interesting.
A year ago if one lone maniac had been lying in Central
Park taking pot shots at passers-by going along Fifth
Avenue they would have run down a side street calling for
the Police, would have gotten home excited and out of
breath, and would have stood outside of the church the
next Sunday after ten o’clock Mass to tell all their friends
what an adventure they had had.</p>

<p>It was magnificent, but it was not war. Especially with
the aeroplanes overhead. Those German aeroplanes—they
circled over our troops in line, over our men in the rear.
Colonel McCoy sent word to inquire about the aeroplanes
that were promised us. General Lenihan wanted to know.
General Menoher sent orders; entreated. But the only ones
we could see had the black Maltese cross—the same old
story.</p>

<p>There was but one thing to do if we would prevent a recurrence
of the catastrophe which had already occurred at
the hospital in that same square. And that was to prevent
the men from gathering there. The kitchen was moved to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
a less exposed spot. This was done to draw the men away
from the square and not from any sense of timidity on the
part of its operatives. On the contrary they had made a
bold attempt to get that kitchen up to the front line. On
the night of July 29th the bold Jim Collintine had hitched
his trusty mules to the beloved goulash wagon and driven
it right up to the Ourcq. When they found they could not
cross, the Mess Sergeant and cooks unloaded its contents
for the men in line. Mooney of Company A tried the same
thing, and, when the river stopped him, sent the food up
on litters.</p>

<p>One of the officers whose duties kept him near the hospital
appointed himself as Police Officer in addition to his
other duties, to keep the men under cover. On the second
day of the fight he saw a tousled looking soldier without
hat or rifle coming from a barn.</p>

<p>“What outfit do you belong to?”</p>

<p>“I belong to the 165th Infantry, sir.”</p>

<p>“What are you doing here?”</p>

<p>“I came in last night with an ammunition detail and we
got scattered under shell fire and I crawled into the barn.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you slept there all night and let the other fellows
do your work. You must be a new man. But I see you
have a service stripe.”</p>

<p>“Well, I am new in the regiment and I don’t belong in
this game. I was in the S. O. S. and they sent me up here
as a replacement after I got into the hospital.”</p>

<p>“Where is your rifle.”</p>

<p>“I lost it and it ain’t no good to me anyway cause I don’t
know anything about it, and I can’t see good anyway.”</p>

<p>The situation was too much for the officer and, like everyone
else in emergency, his mind turned to Captain Walsh.</p>

<p>“Go down that road about forty yards and you will see a
farm yard with soldiers in it and ask for Captain Walsh.
Tell him I sent you and tell him the story you gave me.”</p>

<p>The hatless soldier obeyed very willingly because the
street led towards the rear. An hour later Captain Mike<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
breezed into the square and came over to the officer with
the demand,</p>

<p>“Who was that bird you sent me?”</p>

<p>“What did you do with him, Mike?”</p>

<p>“What did I do with him. I salvaged him a nice new
rifle, strapped two bandoliers around him, led him gently
out into the street, faced him north and said, ‘Keep right
on going in that direction until you see a Dutchman and
when you see him shoot him for me.’ And I gave him a
good start with my boot and by the way he made his getaway
I’ll bet he’s going yet.”</p>

<p>The Commander of our Sanitary Detachment was Captain
Wm. B. Hudson, who had been assigned to us from
the 117th Sanitary Train when Major Lawrence was called
to Division Headquarters. On July 28th, Captain Hudson
had taken his post at the Chateau de Foret, General Lenihan’s
Headquarters, most of which the General had given
over for the accommodation of the wounded who had managed
to get back that far. Here, too, the wounded men met
with fresh disaster. A German aeroplane dropped bombs
in the courtyard and killed seven men, including Sergeant
Brogan of Company B, one of the best men we had.</p>

<p>On the next day Captain Hudson started to look for a
better place for the wounded in Villers sur Fere, accompanied
by the ever-faithful Jewett, the “Y” athletic instructor.
He was standing in the door of the place he had selected
when an enemy gas shell came over and a fragment
of it hit him full in the chest, killing him instantly.</p>

<p>We buried him sadly by the cemetery wall where already
too many of our men were lying in their last long sleep.</p>

<p>In the town also we buried many who were killed by
shell fire as they advanced to go into action during the night
of the 27th-28th. In this our Machine gunners were the
greatest sufferers; almost a whole platoon was wiped out.
A shell landed in the midst of them, creating havoc. The
uninjured rushed boldly to succor their comrades, when
another shell and still another, fell in the same spot, scattering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
death afresh. Sergeant Phil Brooks here gave up
his life and Ray Nulty, J. R. Keller, H. Van Diezelski,
Frank Carlin, G. Foster and C. G. Sahlquist.</p>

<p>Accompanying Lieutenant Connelly on his mission of the
morning of the 28th was the Second Platoon of our Machine
Gun Company under Lieutenant Carter, who was
wounded during the action.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> The Platoon was kept together
by Sergeants Bruhn and Kerrigan, and Doherty, and
afterwards went through the whole battle with our First
Battalion.</p>

<p>While the first battalion was lying under the hill during
the afternoon of the 28th they were very much harassed
by enemy planes which came across flying low and shooting
from their machine guns at the men on the hill and
under the bank. Here Harry Martenson was killed and
Hugh Heaney badly wounded and carried back by Sergeant
Devine. Sergeant Frank Gardella thought it was
time to try reprisals, so he set up his machine gun as an
anti-aircraft weapon and began blazing away at fourteen
planes which were above his head and flying low. He got
a line on two planes which were flying one above the other,
and by a lucky shot hit the pilot of the upper plane which
crashed into the lower one and both came tumbling to
earth not far from the river, their crews being killed.</p>

<p>When Company C was advancing towards Bois Colas
they met opposition from enemy light machine guns some
of which were operating from the tree tops. Lieutenant
Bell’s platoon, Sergeants Stephens and Gardella, Corporals
J. McBride, Paul Fay and Williams were given the task of
dislodging them. They carried up their heavy guns on
their backs, and without taking time to set them up, they
made use of them as if they were automatic rifles, with
great effect, killing or capturing the enemy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span></p>

<p>From the time that Company C took possession of Bois
Colas the Machine Gunners kept their pieces busy from
their positions on the north edge of the woods, keeping
down German fire from Seringes and around Meurcy Farm.
Of their twelve guns, five were put out of action. In the
later encounters Lieutenants Davis and Bell were wounded
and Jack O’Leary, a famous fighting man, received a wound
which afterwards caused his death.</p>

<p>In the front line, on August 1st, there was a comparative
lull in the activity. Our artillery was still going strong,
but the Germans held command of the air and used it to
the full. They flew down to the rear of us and hovered
over the tree-tops of the woods where our artillery was
emplaced, dropping bombs on them and shooting at them
from levels so low that the artillery men answered with
fire from their pistols.</p>

<p>It was the sudden leap of the cat at the dog’s nose before
she turns to flee. At four A. M., August 2nd, our patrols
reported no resistance. Word was sent to the Ohios, but
they found the enemy still in their path. However, under
orders from General Menoher, the whole Division started
forward and found that the main body of the enemy had
gone. Our Infantry hastened on through the Foret de
Nesles, keeping in touch with neighboring regiments left
and right. Finally they encountered resistance near Moreuil
en Dole, north of the forest. The 4th Division was coming
up to relieve us but Colonel MacArthur wanted a last effort
made by his Division. He called on one regiment,
then on another, for a further advance. Their commanders
said truthfully that the men were utterly fatigued and
unable to go forward another step. “It’s up to you, McCoy,”
said the Chief of Staff. Our Colonel called Captain
Martin Meaney, now in command of what was left of the
third battalion. “Captain Meaney, a battalion is wanted
to go ahead and gain contact with the enemy; you may report
on the condition of your men.” “My men are few
and they are tired, sir, but they are willing to go anywhere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
they are ordered, and they will consider an order to advance
as a compliment,” was the manly response. As the brave
and gallant few swung jauntily to their position at the head
of the Division, Colonel MacArthur ejaculated, “By God,
McCoy, it takes the Irish when you want a hard thing
done.” The battalion located the enemy and took up the
fight with them, but already the 4th Division was coming
up and the orders for relief were issued.</p>

<p>In that bloody week the Rainbow Division had met the
4th Prussian Guard Division, commanded by the Kaiser’s
son, Prince Eitel Friedrich, the 201st German and 10th
Landwehr and the 6th Bavarian Division, had driven them
back 18 kilometers to the last ridge south of the Vesle at
a cost in killed and wounded of 184 officers and 5,459 men.</p>

<p>Back came our decimated battalions along the way they
had already traveled. They marched in wearied silence
until they came to the slopes around Meurcy Farm. Then
from end to end of the line came the sound of dry, suppressed
sobs. They were marching among the bodies of
their unburied dead. In the stress of battle there had been
but little time to think of them—all minds had been turned
on victory. But the men who lay there were dearer to them
than kindred, dearer than life; and these strong warriors
paid their bashful involuntary tribute to the ties of love and
long regret that bind brave men to the memory of their
departed comrades.</p>

AFTER THE BATTLE</h2>
</div>

<h3>FORET DE FERE</h3>

<p class="right"><em>August, 1918</em></p>


<p>This is a dirty, dank, unwholesome spot and the daily
rains make it daily more intolerable. But they are keeping
us here in reserve till some division—they say our old
townies of the 77th—has time to come up. The forest has
been occupied by the Germans and its sanitary conditions
are no credit to their boasted efficiency. Sixty per cent of
our men are sick with diarrhœa and everybody is crawling
with cooties. The men are sleeping in shelter tents or in
holes in the ground in the woods and they are a sorry looking
lot.</p>

<p>A number of them have been busy with me in the heart-breaking
task of burying the dead, which is hard for everybody,
but particularly I think, for myself, because I knew
these men so well and loved them as if they were my
younger brothers. It has been the saddest day in my life.
Well, it is the last act of love I can do for them and for the
folks at home. God comfort them in their sorrow. I must
not think of the tragedy of it too much; the main thing is to
keep up the spirits of the living, for battles must still be
fought and the awful price paid if the war is to be won.
Many of us who have come through this will be dead after
the next battle; and if the war lasts another year or so
there will be few, very few left of the infantry in our First
Hundred Thousand. It is a soldier’s fate and we must be
ready for it.</p>

<p>In this one battle nearly half our strength is gone. We
have lost fifty-nine officers and thirteen hundred men and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
of these thirteen officers and about two hundred men have
been killed outright. Many of our wounded have been
badly hurt and we shall have other details to grieve over.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
But in spite of losses and sorrow and sickness I find the men
surprisingly cheerful and willing to carry on. They have
what soldiers most wish for, Victory. And they know now
that the men who opposed their path and had to give way
to their persistence were the famous Prussian Guards, of
the very flower of the German Military Machine. The old
69th had again lived up to its reputation of the past; there
were no German troops, no troops in the world that could
withstand its stubborn bravery.</p>

<p>I went amongst the survivors to gather items for my
chronicle of the war. I may say here as I rewrite these
chapters that I have had to obtain many of the incidents
months afterwards from men that have been wounded, for
many of those who could best tell the story were then lying
suffering from agonizing wounds on hospital cots, and still
burning with the courage and devotion of their race for the
day when they could once more return to the post of danger
with their beloved regiment. These are the real heroes of
the war. It is easy under the stress of emotional enthusiasm
to volunteer for service, but the true test of a man comes
when, after he has faced the danger of sudden death and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
has passed through days of racking pain, he once more
insists, in spite of offers of easier service from kindly officers,
on taking his place again in the battle line with his old
comrades. And now that the war is over, there is nothing
that stirs my blood like the petty arrogance of some officials
in hospitals and casual camps who rebuke the requests of
men (many of whom have been wounded and gone back
into line and got wounded again) to rejoin their former
outfits. My malison on their tribe.</p>

<p>I shall present first the lists of names mentioned for good
work (a soldier’s meed) and afterwards incidents of more
general interest. Company A gives credit to three snipers
for working out to the front ahead of them and making the
Fritzies keep their heads down during the attack on July
29th: Corporal Charles Hallberg, Edwin Stubbs, and John
McDonald. They also spoke highly of their Sergeants or
Acting Sergeants on whom leadership devolved during the
fight: Joseph Higginson, Joseph Pettit, John R. Scully,
Hugh McFadden, Harry Blaustein, Will Mehl, Don Matthews,
Michael Walsh, Frederick Garretson, Sidney Clark,
and John Dennelly. With Dennelly in the occupation of
Meurcy Farm were John Sheehy, Maurice Cotter, Pilger,
Newton, Thorn, Iverson and Frechales. Besides Henderson,
those who distinguished themselves by liaison work
were Corporal Lester Hanley, Joseph M. McKinney, Michael
Polychrom, Louis Tiffany, John Gannon and Edwin
Dean. Litter Bearers: Matt Kane, Howard Hamm and
in a volunteer capacity Cook Edward Mooney, Albert Cooper,
August Trussi. Others mentioned with high praise are
Patrick Thynne, Patrick J. Doolin, Fred Stenson, John J.
Morrissey, James Partridge, Paul Smith, John Barrett,
Richard Campion, Louis Cornibert, Brady and Buckley.</p>

<p>If Company B ever loses its big Captain they have already
a candidate of their own to succeed him in his senior
lieutenant, John J. Clifford, a cool and capable officer, as
all his men say. The greatest loss the Company has suffered
is from the death of the First Sergeant, John O’Neill,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
a remarkable old soldier with regular army experience,
who was frightfully wounded by shell fire while getting up
supplies, and died in hospital. Al Dunn, a game youth, was
hit by the same shell, but refused to allow anybody to touch
him until O’Neill was looked after. Among other good
men who received wounds were John Mooney, William
Judge, Al Whalen, Harry Guenther, Dan Finnegan,
Thomas Fitzpatrick, Vincent Farrell, Francis X. Goodwin,
and William O’Sullivan. The platoon under Lieutenant
Wheatley that joined the attack with Company A, had for
its non-coms Edward Kelly, Langan, Cullinan, Travis, Patrick
Kelly, Foster, Tinker, McClymont and Mearns. Lieutenant
Clifford had high praise for Sergeant Thomas, who
had gone out on the night of July 28th to repulse a counter-attack
of the Germans and, of those in the detachment,
Connie Reuss, Corporal Michael Tierney, a Clare man, who
was killed; and also amongst the killed Charles Chambers,
a patriotic volunteer who leaves a wife to mourn him in the
city of Dublin. James Dwyer, Joseph McCarthy, Joseph
Maher and John A. Lane were also badly wounded. As
John A. Lane was lying out in a very exposed position his
namesake, John B. Lane, a lad of eighteen, and the pride
of the Company as a clever little boxer, declared that he was
going out to carry the other in. He did so without scath,
but was killed three days later in front of Meurcy Farm.
Private Frank McGovern received praise for a similar action
on the 29th; also Harold Kyte, Thomas Walsh, John
O’Connor, James Lannon, James Austin and John Matthews,
litter bearers. John Mahoney especially distinguished
himself in this line, carrying the wounded to the
rear and then lugging up food for the surviving fighters.
Good liaison work was done by Charles Weick, James
Murray, James Brennan, Ed. Powers, Jim Brundage, Arthur
LaSalle, and John Kane, a youngster of seventeen.
Thomas Herlihy and Charles Kavanagh were also commended.</p>

<p>Inquiry at Company C gave me the name of John Teevan,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
who on the 31st left cover to save a wounded comrade and
was himself wounded while doing it; Sergeant Herman Hillig,
always a good man, who led the advance patrol on the
29th; Corporal Frank Drivdahl, who took charge of a half
platoon when his seniors were wounded and led it into
handgrips with the enemy. All of the non-coms distinguished
themselves. First Sergeant Gene Halpin, always a
steady leader; Tom O’Hagan, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">beau ideal</i> of an Irish
soldier; Sergeants Joe Hennessey, John Knight, John McAuliffe,
Peter Keller, Frank Colyer, Corporals Frank Duffy,
James Barry, Charles Quinn, Edward Gordon, Edward
Brown, and amongst those wounded Arthur Totten, Arthur
Slicklen, Peter Gammel, the Peisel brothers, and Denis
Cahill, sturdiest of old-timers. This Company claims that
it has the most heroic and devoted lot of litter bearers that
ever deliberately took their lives in their hands. By the
stories I hear it is hard to choose between them. They are
Thomas P. McPherson, Edmond McCarthy, James and Joseph
Burns (twins in birth and twins in courage) and Edward
F. Brown. They were always at the front, day and
night, and they should all have the Distinguished Service
Cross. Liaison men mentioned are Clarence Smith and
Vivian Commons. Others that received praise were Frederick
Craven, Corporal Childress, who came over on the
torpedoed <em>Tuscania</em> and joined us at Baccarat; Corporal
Pat Moran, Thomas Leddy, James Heaney; and Mess Sergeant
Grace with cooks Duffy and Wilson, who won the
eternal gratitude of the Company by carrying food to them
in line.</p>

<p>William Hisle was one of the first names I got from
Company D, a man who did extraordinarily fine work as
a litter bearer. John J. Kolodgy also, and Edward Coxe
(wounded at the same task and sticking on the job until
killed) are in the same class. Liaison men: Louis Murphy,
William P. White, John Conway, John Dale, Frank
DeMuth; while others mentioned are Mess Sergeant Edward
McIntee, Pat Crowley, “the wild Irishman,” Pat Grogan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
(wounded again), John L. Burke, Peter Carberry,
Charles Edgerton, Richard Dwyer (who said “Tend to me
last” when wounded), Thomas Keyes, Sergeant Denis
Murphy, badly wounded; Denis O’Connor, Charles Lynch,
Everett Smith, John Cahill, Andrew O’Rourke, Peter
O’Sullivan, Martin Hurst, Arthur Comer, John L. Thompson,
John Cox, Joseph P. Tracy and Patrick Finn (both
’98 men) and Fred Urban, a new man and a great shot with
the rifle, with Chief Powless and Tony Zaliski.</p>

<p>Company E told me of Michael Breen, who received his
death wound, covering the advance of his Company by the
use of smoke grenades; William Foley and James Fitzpatrick,
going out under fire to rescue two companions;
George M. Failing, who did noble work as a litter bearer;
John Costello, Thomas Cullen (both killed), with Bechtold
and William Goldenburg, four privates who saved their
Company by putting a machine gun out of action. Sergeant
Augustus T. Morgan, also Sergeant Frank Johnston
and Corporal John Cronin did heroic work.</p>

<p>Company F, Bernard Corcoran got a bullet across both
his eyeballs which will render him blind for life. John Fitzgibbon,
Michael Douglas, Frank Dunn, Charles Dougherty,
William Garry, Leo Hanifin, Owen Carney, George D.
Lannon, Frank Kelly, Gottfried Kern, Edward Chabot,
James McCormack, John McAuliffe, Daniel McGrath,
Peter McGuiness, William McQuade, John P. Mahon,
Herbert Doyle, Peter Malloy, shot through the lung, William
Mulligan, Charles O’Leary and William Moran, Sergeant
Pat Wynne, John Smith, Peter Rogers, Frank
Sweeney and William Walsh are on the honor roll.</p>

<p>Company G had the greatest praise for Edmund Reardon
and Charles McGeary, who did remarkable work saving
others until finally death came to themselves. Others mentioned
with praise are Corporal Edward Fitzgerald and Sergeant
Edward McNamara, who had to be ordered out of
the line when wounded. Also Corporal David Fitzgibbons,
Thomas Meade, Michael Shea, Michael O’Brien, Patrick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
Donohue, Frank Cahill, Thomas Bohan, First Sergeant
John Meaney, Corporal Frank Garland, Thomas McGowan,
James Brennan, Sergeant James Coffey; Robert Monohan
and Patrick McNamara, liaison men; and Maurice Dwyer,
mechanic, who always dropped his tools and picked up a
rifle when a battle was on.</p>

<p>Company H thinks that it is about time that Sergeant
Dudley Winthrop got a citation. His latest feat was to go
wandering out in the open where everybody that went had
been hit, searching out his wounded comrades. Martin
Higgins has also been recommended for citation for the
same kind of heroic activity. Patrick Reynolds went out
alone and, by expert sniping at close range, put out of action
a machine gun that was holding up the advance. Later
on, he was killed. Sergeant John J. Walker kept his platoon
going when his seniors were wounded. Callahan,
Dunseith, Ernst, Conway, Bealin, McDonald, O’Brien, McKenna,
Sweeney, White, Frieburger, Crose and Bushey are
also recommended for excellent work.</p>

<p>I have already gone through the list of Company I, so I
shall just add an additional list of non-coms who were
wounded: Sergeants Harold J. Murphy and William Lyle,
Corporals Wilton Wharton, Charles Beckwith, L. Vessell,
James Brady, William Burke, William Crossin, Patrick
Farrell, Alfred Georgi, Hugh Kelly, Michael Learnahan,
John Maddock, H. R. Morton, Patrick O’Brien, Francis
O’Neill, Edward Powers, William Reutlinger, and James
Sullivan.</p>

<p>The men from Company I whose names were selected at
the time for a Regimental Citation were First Sergeant Patrick
McMeniman, who was really in command of the Company
during most of the trying time on the hill; Dexter,
Dynan, Howard, Coen, Farley, Coppinger, Battersby, and
Lesser as stretcher bearers; Cook Michael J. O’Brien, who
carried food to the front line no matter how dangerous it
was, and carried wounded on the return trip; and Thomas
A. Boyle, who seeing an abandoned automatic rifle ran<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
forward under vicious fire, loaded it and started it working
against the enemy; and finally, William B. Lyons, prominent
as liaison man and stretcher bearer.</p>

<p>Company K recommends Nicholas E. Grant, a liaison
man, along with its heroic Captain, Sergeant Joe Farrell,
Victor Van Yorx, John Doyle, stretcher bearer, and the
self-sacrificing William Bergen, Francis I. Kelly, also a
martyr to loyalty, as he was killed while rendering first aid
to Lieutenant Stott. Burr Finkle and John J. McLaughlin
are recommended for a display of extraordinary heroism.</p>

<p>In Company L the valiant Captain and Lieutenant Spencer
have been recommended for the D. S. C. For rescue
work, Thomas Deignan, Joseph Coogan, John Ahern, Joseph
Grace, Charles Oakes, William Hughes, Michael Fallon
(twice wounded) and James Santori, the latter being
killed while placing a wounded man on a stretcher. Lieutenant
Wellbourne, with the Sergeants already mentioned,
and also Corporals Edward McDonough, Harry McDermott,
Eugene McCue, and Wild Bill Ryan distinguished
themselves by their work in the line. So, too, did James
Judge, Thomas Boyle, Eddie Bloom, Arthur Campbell,
John Burke, Will Coleman, John Murphy, Matt Devlin,
Hugh Fagan, Fred Meyers, Leslie Quackenbush, John Mulvey,
Peter O’Connor, Maurice Powers, Val Roesel, John
B. McHugh, Sam Ross, Peter Deary, James Streffler, Harry
Baldwin, expert sniper, and Eddie Morrissey, liaison man.</p>

<p>Captain Meaney of Company M gave the highest recommendation
to Lieutenant Collier and also to Corporals
Thomas J. Courtney and Patrick Ames, both of them soldiers
of remarkable coolness and resolution. The men of
this Company were kept busy throughout the week as food
and ammunition carriers and stretcher bearers. Amongst
those who distinguished themselves in these tasks were Corporals
James Duffy and Jack Manson, with Edward Mendes,
Daniel Leahy, William Lynch, John Feeley, Thomas Ferrier,
William O’Neill, Frank Sisco, James Shanahan, Edward
Flanagan, Patrick Bryne, Frank Cullum, James Igo,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
James A. Watts, the Rodriguez brothers and Herbert Dunlay.</p>

<p>Captain Walsh of Headquarters Company recommended
Sergeant Arthur Jaeger, Sergeant John J. Ryan, Corporal
Charles Leister of the one-pounders, with Corporal Leslie
Reynolds and Privates Robert Callaghan, Clarence Cumpston,
Maurice Small, Charles Goecking, Spencer Sully, John
C. McLaughlin and William Hearn (who also did heroic
work rescuing the wounded), Corporal A. A. Brochon and
Privates James P. McCabe and Arthur Olsen and Kirwin
of the Signal Platoon. In the Stokes Mortars Sergeant
Thomas Fitzsimmons, Jeremiah J. Casey, Thomas J. Kelly
and Malcolm Robertson, Thomas J. Taylor, Herbert Clarke
with Moore, Wisner, Hayes, Nugent, Robb, Levins, Orr,
Shannon, Dugdale, and my old friend, John Mahon, who
always has some special reason why he should be selected
as a member of every gun crew sent to the front line;
George Utermehle, Stable Sergeant; Jerome Goldstein,
Mess Sergeant; with Cooks John A. Wilker, Maher McAvoy
and Wagoner James Collintine; and Jim Turner,
wounded while doing courageous work as a liaison man.</p>

<p>The Machine Gun Company cites their runners, John L.
B. Sullivan, William Murphy, Hantschke, Charles Smith,
and James Ledwith. Also Lieutenant Billings, who had the
dangerous task of keeping up the supply of ammunition,
which he accomplished with the aid of two excellent non-coms,
Sid Ryan and Joe McCourt (one of the most efficient
men in the whole regiment). Every man in the company
sang the praises of Bill Sheppard, Paul Fay and Pete Gillespie;
also of Leon Baily and Frank Gardella, who spent
their leisure moments carrying in Company C’s wounded.</p>

<p>The Supply Company wagoners Peter J. Seagriff, Albert
Richford, A. Brown, Philip Smith and Thomas J. Ferris,
won praise for difficult and dangerous tasks courageously
performed by night and day.</p>

<p>The Sanitary Detachment, in addition to those mentioned,
gave me Milledge Whitlock, Louis Bidwell, John<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
McKeough, John P. Murphy, Patrick Fawcett, Thomas V.
Boland, Walter Clark and Sergeant Arthur Firman. Whitlock,
Wright and Walker were at an advance aid-post under
the river bank all week long.</p>

<p>The most striking incident I heard described took place in
Company D as they were waiting in the street of Villers sur
Fere about three o’clock in the morning of the 28th. The
Germans were raking the streets with high explosives and
shrapnel, and men were falling, hit by the flying pieces.
The most trying moment in battle is going into action under
shell fire, especially at night. The shells come
wh-e-e-e-zing over. One goes Whannng! up the road—another
in a field to the right! Then one falls on a house
and the tiles, plaster, fragments of stone are scattered over
the men who are lying in the lee of it. Then another comes,
more menacing in its approaching whistle. Men run, drop
on the ground, stand petrified. And it lands in the midst
of them. There are cries, ceasing suddenly as if cut off
with a knife, curses, sobs of “Oh, God!” “They got me!”
“For God’s sake, pick me up, Jim.” The survivors rush
back, ripping open their First Aid packages, the non-coms
bawling orders, everybody working in a frenzy to save the
wounded. And then perhaps another shell landing in the
same place will send them all away from the troubles of
this awful world.</p>

<p>Company D was going through all this, and for the time
being, without officers. Buck was gassed the day before;
Connelly and Daly had gone off to execute their difficult
operation to the right, First Sergeant Geaney being
with them; Burke was away on his mission of danger and
glory. The remaining Lieutenant had been called to receive
orders. Two corporals, Patrick McDonough and John
Gribbon, had been working hard, giving first aid to the
wounded, and they began to worry about the possible effect
of the shelling on the men. So they went up the line
to look for some person in higher authority.</p>

<p>They found no officer but they did find Sergeant Tom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
O’Malley sitting against a stone wall, sucking philosophically
at his pipe, as if the wall were the side of a stone fence
in his native Connemara. Now the sight of Tom O’Malley
breeds confidence in the heart of every soldier in Company
D.</p>

<p>“Where’s the officers, Tom?”</p>

<p>“Oi don’t know where th’ hell they are,” says Tom, between
puffs of his pipe, and in the slow, soft speech of the
West Coast Irish, “If ye were in camp and ye didn’t want
to see thim, ye’d be thrippin’ over thim. But now whin ye
want t’ know what ye got to do in a foight ye can’t find
wan of thim.”</p>

<p>“Well, Tom, we’ll elect you Captain and you take charge
of the men until some of the officers get back, or they may
be getting out of hand.”</p>

<p>“No, lads, Oi don’t fancy meself in a Sam Brown belt.
Dick O’Neill here is a noice young fellah, so we’ll elect
Dick Captain, and O’ll make ye fellahs do what he tells ye.”
So Sergeant O’Neill, a youth of twenty-one, took charge of
the situation, got the men together in small groups under
their non-coms, and in places of comparative safety, and
had them all ready when Lieutenant Cook came back from
the conference to issue their orders to cross the Ourcq.</p>

<p>It is something that we call typically American that a
number of men under a stress and in an emergency like this,
should get together, choose their own leaders and obey
them implicitly for the common good. These four men are
Americans of the type we are proudest of. Yet it is worth
noting that three out of the four were born in an island
whose inhabitants, we are often told, are unfit for self-government.
As for Dick O’Neill, he is one hundred per
cent American, but it would take a braver man than I can
claim to be to tell Dick O’Neill that he is not Irish, too.</p>

<p>One of the members of D Company who was wounded
in this spot was Matt Sullivan, an old-timer, and a kindly
pleasant man who always took an interest in the younger
lads, so that he was known as “Pop.” His two special protégés<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
were Barney Friedman and George Johnson. When
he was hit he was ordered to the rear, but he said, “I’ll not
stir out o’ this till I see if the children are safe, God bless
them.” He hobbled around in the gray dawn until he found
the boys and then started for the rear.</p>

<p>Company I had a number of little battle pictures to give
me besides those I have already written. One was of Barney
Farley, who was busy all morning dressing wounds, and
after he had stopped the flow of blood, before picking up
his man, he would roll a cigarette, stick it in the wounded
man’s mouth with a cheery “Here, take a pull out of this,
avic. It’ll do ye good.”</p>

<p>Mike Lenihan, wounded while on the hill and told to go
back, said, “No, I’ve waited so long to get at them I won’t
lave this hill.” Another shot got him, and he was carried
off.</p>

<p>Tom Shannon, being carried in, got off his stretcher and
wanted to give his place to another man who, he said, was
worse wounded than himself. An officer ordered him
back on the stretcher and he was carried in, and since then
I have heard he has died of his wounds.</p>

<p>William Cleary, wounded in the shoulder, refused to
leave without orders, so they led him to where Captain
Ryan was lying in a shell hole, himself wounded. The
Captain looked up at him. “You’ve got a bad wound. No
use around here. You’re young—got good color in your
face—live long. Got good legs yet—run like hell.”</p>

<p>The Captain saw a German near the top of the hill who
was using an automatic, and he wanted to try a shot at him,
so he borrowed Pat Flynn’s rifle, fired and missed, the pain
of the recoil disconcerting his aim. He tried again; then he
said: “I’m going to pull the last bit of Irish in me together
and get that fellow.” With the last shot in the clip he got
him.</p>

<p>Two men from Company L had a laugh about Fortgang,
who, one of them said, is the champion moocher of the
Company, and can always get something to eat no matter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
how short the rations are. They were lying out on that
shot-swept hill on the morning of the 28th when Fortgang
produced from somewhere a can of solidified alcohol and
three strips of bacon. He calmly proceeded to start his little
fire, and fried his bacon, which he shared with the men
on each side of him; and thus fortified, picked up his rifle
once more and began to blaze away at the Germans.</p>

<p>While the topic is food I may add that the whole company
is devoted to Mess Sergeant McDonald and Cook Connelly,
whose kitchen was hit but who swore they would
“stick to it while there’s a spoke left in it.” Hugh Fagan
was one of the men who had to be driven off the hill after
being badly wounded.</p>

<p>I saw several men who were hit through the helmet, the
bullet entering in front and going out at the back without
inflicting a wound. One of them was Edward McDonough,
who seemed to consider it a great joke, though another man
who had the same thing happen to him, a man whom I did
not know, was walking in wide circles, unable to pursue a
steady course unless he had a wall or a fence to guide on.</p>

<p>Captain Hurley of Company K got four or five wounds
at once in leg, arm and back, but refused to allow himself
to be carried, saying impatiently, “Now, don’t be bothering
with me. I’d like to see myself on a litter while there’s
men much worse off than myself still lying on the ground.”</p>

<p>I was in the dressing station one evening when a sturdy
young lieutenant walked in with one hand almost blown
away. He announced himself to be Lieutenant Wolf of the
150th Machine Gun Battalion, and settled down on the table
for his operation with more coolness than most people display
when getting their photograph taken. He had just one
thing on his mind, and that did not concern himself. He had
come in with an ammunition detail, which was ready to start
back when a shell got him just outside the hospital door.
That detail had to go back. He was much relieved, one
would say perfectly contented, when I assured him that I
would convey his orders to the sergeant in charge.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
Through such men battles are won, and nations made famous
for bravery.</p>

<p>On one of the days of the battle I was coming up the
street of Villers sur Fere with Jack Percy when an enemy
gun began to land shells just across the narrow street from
us. We dropped alongside a wall when the shriek of the
first one told us it was coming across the home plate, and
as we lay there I saw a ration wagon coming down the road
with George Utermehle, Sergeant of mounted section, H. Q.
Company, on the box. George had no whip and was urging
his team by throwing cherries at their heads. I shouted at
him, “This is a bad corner just now, they’re shelling it.”
“Oh, this old team of mine can beat out any shell,” said
George, as he hit the ear of his off animal with a cherry;
and he went tearing by in time to miss the next, and, I was
happy to find out, the last one that came over.</p>

<p>I overheard a conversation in the woods which gave me
a good story on Major Donovan. The majority of his battalion
have always looked on him as the greatest man in the
world. But a certain number were resentful and complaining
on account of the hard physical drilling he has continually
given them to keep them in condition for just the
sort of thing they had to go through last week. As a result
of watching him through six days of battle—his coolness,
cheerfulness, resourcefulness—there is now no limit to their
admiration for him. What I overheard was the partial conversion
of the last dissenter. He still had a grouch about
what he had been put through during the past year, and
three other fellows were pounding him with arguments to
prove Donovan’s greatness. Finally he said grudgingly,
“Well, I’ll say this: Wild Bill is a son of a ——, but he’s a
game one.” When I told it to Donovan, he laughed and
said, “Well, Father, when I’m gone write that as my epitaph.”</p>

<p>I shall always think that the finest compliment paid to
Major Donovan was the devotion of John Patrick Kayes,
an Irishman, very tall, very thin, somewhat stoop-shouldered,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
not at all young, and a servant of the rich in civil
life. The Irish in him had made him a volunteer. He was
put in charge of the Battalion H. Q. mess, and I used to tell
Donovan that I came to visit him, not on account of his own
attractions, but because of what John Kayes had to offer
me. He refused to remain behind in action. He wanted
to be where the Major was, though he knew that anybody
who kept near Donovan stood an excellent chance of being
killed. On July 31st he went forward with him on his
restless rounds, which led them out of the shelter of Bois
Colas into the open country. A German machine gun began
firing at them and Kayes was struck in the ankle. He
fell forward into the path of the bullets and as different
portions of his long body neared the ground he was hit
successively in the thigh, arm and face. He still had
strength enough to protest that the Major should not risk
himself by carrying him in. He died in hospital weeks
later, his last thoughts being that Major Donovan would be
neglected with him gone. The terms “hero” and “butler”
are not generally associated in fiction, but they met in the
person of John Patrick Kayes.</p>

<p>Major Lawrence tells me that he met Captain P. P. Rafferty,
a doctor in our Divisional Sanitary Train, who told
him,</p>

<p>“We had an original character from your outfit through
here last week—a Lieutenant Connelly. He was lying on
a cot and in a good deal of pain, I knew, when I was surprised
to hear him laugh a hearty laugh. I thought he was
going out of his head and I went over to him and said,
‘What’s happened to you that’s funny, Lieutenant?’”</p>

<p>“‘Oh,’ he said, ‘I was just thinking about something.’</p>

<p>“‘Let me in on it,’ I said. ‘There is not much to amuse
a man happening around here.’</p>

<p>“‘Well,’ said he, ‘it’s just an incident of battle. I was
in command of a Company that had just about forty men
left, and Major Donovan gave me orders to send some of
them one way and some another and take the rest and capture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
a woods and Meurcy Farm. Just after I started I got
into a mix-up and was put out of action and my first
thought was ‘Thank God! Now I don’t have to take that
damn farm.’”</p>

<p>One of my own prayers of Thanksgiving is “Praise be!
Major Lawrence is back.” When I told him so he thanked
me for the compliment, but I said, “George, don’t take it as
coming from me. It is only for my own peace of mind.
Since the day you left I have been pestered by everybody,
officers and men, who have the right to wear your red cross
armlet, with the plaintive petition, ‘Father Duffy, can’t you
do something to get our Major back?’”</p>

<p>We joke Rerat about the size of the French rivers. I
told him that one of our soldiers lay badly wounded near
the river, and I offered him a pull at my canteen. Raising
himself on one elbow and throwing out his arm in a Sir
Philip Sydney fashion, he exclaimed, “Give it to the Ourcq,
it needs it more than I do.”</p>

<p>The Germans nearly had a grim joke on me during the
action. We picked up our dead in the town, and I had the
Pioneers dig me a long trench on the south side of the
cemetery wall, which screened them from observation while
their own trench would give protection. I said “This spot
is the safest place in France.” We finished our sad task
and went away. A few hours later I passed that way
again and found that the wall against which I was sitting
was smashed to the ground; a tree eight inches in diameter
which had shaded me was blown in two, and two other missiles
had exploded five feet from the line of graves. Evidently
a German aviator, seeing the freshly turned earth,
thought that it was a gun emplacement and dropped three
of his nasty eggs. I smiled grimly as my words came back,
“The safest place in France.”</p>

<p>Going through the woods I heard John McMorrow discussing
a date with Monzert of Headquarters Company,
and he was saying, “It happened the first day we went over.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
I tell you it was. It was on the mornin’ that we crossed the
O’Rourke River and captured Murphy’s Farm.”</p>

<p>Colonel McCoy felt deeply grieved at the news of Quentin
Roosevelt’s heroic death in an air battle some time before,
as he knew him from boyhood, having been military
aide at the White House during part of President Roosevelt’s
term of office. We knew that Lieutenant Roosevelt
had met his death in this sector, and our Colonel had instituted
inquiries to find if any person had discovered his
grave. Word was brought to him that the grave had been
found in the sector to our right, which was occupied by the
32nd Division, and Colonel McCoy determined to have it
suitably marked. I had a cross made and inscribed by
Julius Horvath, and the Colonel with Lieutenant Preston
and myself went by automobile to the place to erect it over
the grave. We found the roughly made cross formed from
pieces of his broken plane that the Germans had set to
mark the place where they buried him. The plot had already
been ornamented with a rustic fence by the soldiers
of the 32nd Division. We erected our own little monument
without molesting the one that had been left by the
Germans. It is fitting that enemy and friend alike should
pay tribute to heroism.</p>

<p>The Germans had not retreated ten miles before the advance
guard of the French civilian population began coming
in to take possession of their shattered homes. I was coming
down today from the battlefield whither I had gone
with Emmet Watson and Bill Fernie to make a map of
the graves when I met the incoming civilians in Villers sur
Fere. Most of them were men who had been sent ahead
by the family to see what was left. But occasionally we
met a stout old peasant woman pulling a small cart behind
her on which rested all her earthly substance, or a hay-cart
drawn by oxen with the family possessions in it and two
or three chubby youngsters with their mother perched on
top. I followed a middle aged farmer and his son into one
of the houses near the church and we made our inspection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
together. All the plaster had been knocked off the walls
and the glass from the windows, and there was a big hole
in the roof, and altogether it looked anything but a home,
but after looking it all over the young man said to his
father, with a satisfied grunt, “Pas trop demoli” (not too
badly banged up). I certainly admired the optimism and
courage of people who could take up their lives once more
with cheerfulness under such desperate conditions.</p>

<p>The Germans had made their most of the time in which
they had possession of this salient. They had harvested
a great deal of the grain and anything else that was already
ripe and in some places they had ransacked the houses of
any goods that were worth while. There were many evidences,
though, that they had no idea that they were so
soon to be dislodged. At Seringes they had installed an
electric light plant, and the French road signs had been supplemented
with the large legible German signs. Their sense
of security was the cause of their largest losses in material,
as they had made of the Forest of Fere a great ammunition
dump, and the large shells, gas, shrapnel, high explosives,
were left behind by thousands.</p>

<p>I got back to Château Thierry looking for hospitals which
might contain our wounded but found none of them, as
they had all been transferred to other places, no one knew
exactly where. In the burying ground I hit upon the graves
of Sergeant John O’Neill of B and Sergeants Peter Crotty
and Bernard McElroy of K and Walter Wandless of H.
The city already presented a lively appearance with a great
deal of traffic, not all of it military, over the bridge of boats
which replaced the bridge that had been destroyed during
the German drive.</p>

<p>Our men are getting more and more restless in these dirty
woods and the first question that anybody asks is, “When
do we get relieved.” I stepped into the woods on the other
side of the road to visit my Alabama friends and one of
their fine lads voiced the common mind by asking whether
the govament hadn’t othah soldiehs than the Fohty-Second<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
Division. I answered, “Well, if they’re using you so much,
it is your own fault.” “How is it ouah fault?” demanded
my friend, and twenty pairs of eyes asked the same question.
“It’s your fault all right; the trouble with you fellows
is that you’re too blamed good.”</p>

<p>I have become a specialist on what they call the morale of
troops and as I go around I find that the morale of the
men in this division is still very high. They have had a
tough week of it and nearly half the infantry are gone while
of those remaining more than half are sick. But they know
that they have whipped the enemy on his chosen ground and
they feel confident that if they only get rested up a little bit
they can do it again and do it cheerfully.</p>

<p>The Quartermaster’s Department has helped considerably
by fitting us all out with new clothes, underwear, shoes,
everything we need, and the food supply is steady. And
Miss Elsie Janis has done her part, too, as a joy producer
by coming up to us in our mud and desolation and giving
a Broadway performance for an audience which was more
wildly appreciative than ever acclaimed her on the street of
a million lights.</p>

<p>The long desired orders for relief finally arrived. We
marched out on Sunday morning, August 11th. I had
planned with Colonel McCoy to have my Sunday Service a
memorial one for the brave lads we were leaving behind.
He had me set up my altar in an open field just south of
the forest on our line of march to the rear. The men, fully
equipped for the march, came down the road, turned into
the field, stripped their packs and formed a hollow square
around the altar. After Mass I preached on the text,
“Greater love than this no man hath than that he lay down
his life for his friends.” When the service was over the
regiment took the road again and began its march, with
the band in advance and the regimental wagon train in the
rear.</p>

<p>As we passed through Beuvardes General Menoher and
officers of his staff were in front of Division Headquarters.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
Colonel McCoy passed the order down the ranks, the band
struck up the regimental air of “Garry Owen” and the
regiment passed in review, heads up and chests out and
stepping out with a martial gait as if they were parading
at Camp Mills and not returning from a battlefield where
half their numbers had been lost.</p>

<p>Two days later they marched through Château Thierry
in similar fashion. Colonel McCoy came to mess with a
smile of pride on his face telling us he had encountered an
old friend, a regular army officer who had said to him,
“What is that outfit that passed here a little while ago?
It’s the finest looking lot of infantry I have seen in France.”
“That is the 165th Infantry, more widely known to fame
as the 69th New York, and I am proud to say that I command
it.”</p>

<p>I have been playing truant for a few days. I had been
suffering with a great sense of fatigue. Nothing particular
the matter, but I felt as if I were running on four flat
tires and one cylinder. Two of the War Correspondents,
Herbert Corey and Lincoln Eyre, came along and insisted
on bringing me down to their place in Château Thierry;
and General Lenihan brought me in in his car. Corey
cooked supper—a regular <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cordon bleu</i> affair—and Lincoln
Eyre gave me a hot bath and, like Kipling’s soldier, “God,
I needed it so.” Then they bundled me into Tom Johnson’s
bed, and as I dropped asleep I thought, and will continue
to think, that they are the finest fellows in the world.
They were ordered out next morning and I went with them
for a couple of days to Bossuet’s old episcopal city of
Meaux, where I had a fine time gossiping with Major Morgan,
Bozeman Bulger and Arthur Delaney of the Censor’s
Bureau and Ray Callahan, Arthur Ruhl and Herbert Bailey,
a delightful young Englishman who writes for the <cite>Daily
Mail</cite>.</p>

<p>I rejoined the regiment at Saulchery—somebody says
that sounds like a name for a decadent cocktail—and found
myself housed in a large and pleasant villa, the garden of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
which looked out upon vineyards and fields down to the
banks of the Marne. It was one of the pleasantest places
we had been in in France. The weather was perfect, and
the men enjoyed the camping out in their shelter tents, especially
since the river was handy for a swim. The whole
thing made us feel more like campers than soldiers. And
by the time we had gotten well rested up and most of the
cooties washed off, we had forgotten the hard days that
were past and saw only the bright side of life once more.</p>

<p>We were there from August 12th to 17th, on which latter
date we entrained at Château Thierry to go to our new
training area. This was down in the Neufchateau district,
and to get to it by the railroad we were using we went
south until we got to the vicinity of Langres, where we had
spent our last two months before going into the trench
sector. Regimental headquarters was at Goncourt and the
regiment was accommodated in barracks and billets in that
and two close lying villages. The towns had been used for
some time by American troops and had unusual facilities
for bathing, etc. The warm reception given to us by the
townspeople was a tribute to the good conduct of the 23rd
Infantry which had been billetted there for a considerable
period before occupying the front lines.</p>

<p>After a couple of days’ rest the men were started on a
schedule of training which was laid out for four weeks.
Target ranges were prepared by the engineers and everything
looked like a long stay. The training was necessary
not so much for the old-timers as for the replacements
who had been sent in to take the places of the men we had
lost. We received five hundred from the 81st Division.
We had known cases where our replacements had to go
into line without anything like proper training. The night
we left Epieds to advance into action at the Ourcq we received
new men, some of whom knew very little about a
rifle and had never once put on a gas mask; and the Captains
took them out by night and drilled them for an hour
with the gas masks in order to give the poor fellows some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
sort of a chance for their lives if exposed to danger of gas.</p>

<p>The second day that I was in Goncourt Colonel McCoy
came to see me with Major Lawrence and Major Donovan
to lay down the law. They had decided that I was to go to
the hospital at Vittel, where Major Donovan’s brother was
one of the doctors, “for alterations and repairs.” General
Menoher, with his usual kindness, sent over his car to take
me there, and Father George Carpentier was brought over
from the Sanitary Train to fill my place. I told him “Your
name is French but it has the advantage of being the one
French name that is best known and most admired by our
bunch of pugilists.”</p>

<p>I have had a nice lazy week of it at Vittel, which was a
French watering place before the war, the hotels and parks
now being given over to American soldiers. I hear a great
deal of talk about a coming offensive in which the American
Army is to take the leading part. I had gotten an inkling
of it before from a French source, with strictest injunctions
to secrecy. But here in Vittel I find it discussed by
private soldiers on the park benches and by the old lady who
sells newspapers. If it is a secret, all the world seems to
know it. We have taken every step to make the Germans
aware of it except that of putting paid advertisements in
the Berlin newspapers. The fact is, these things cannot
be kept secret. Here in Vittel they are cleaning out all the
hospitals of wounded and that means that a big battle is
expected somewhere in this vicinity within a short time.
Then up along the line ammunition and supply trains are
busy establishing dumps, and the drivers are naturally talking
about it in the cafés, so that everybody knows that the
Americans are planning something big and the place where
it is going to happen.</p>

<p class="right"><em>August</em> 24th, 1918</p>


<p>Major Donovan is over every few days to have his
wound attended to and incidentally to see his brother Tim,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
who is a surgeon with the Buffalo Unit. Today he gave
me a piece of news that came as a shock though hardly as
a surprise—the orders are out to make Colonel McCoy a
Brigadier General and he is to leave us. He has been with
us less than four months yet I feel as if I had known him
for forty years, and this war is going to be a different sort
of thing for me lacking his presence. But the staying thing
about life is that institutions go on even though men may
pass. My thoughts turned to the regiment.</p>

<p>“Who is likely to be Colonel?” I asked.</p>

<p>“We are all united on Mitchell,” said the Major, “and
I think General McCoy will be able to arrange it for us.”</p>

<p>“I have always thought that General McCoy can do anything
he sets out to do. As for Mitchell, with the possible
exception of yourself, Major, there is no man I had rather
see have it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Hell, Father, I don’t want to be Colonel. As
Lieutenant Colonel I can get into the fight and that’s what
I’m here for. We all want Mitchell.”</p>

<p>“You are a selfish creature, Bill. Did you ever see anybody
more contented in action than the man you want to
tie up to a telephone?”</p>

<p>“Well, somebody has to be tied up to the telephone, McCoy
didn’t like it, nor MacArthur. And then, as you know,
they can always find some reason to get away from it and
have a little excitement.”</p>


<h3>VITTEL</h3>


<p class="right"><em>August</em> 29th, 1918</p>


<p>The orders have come already to move up to the next
battle area. Instead of having a month for rest and training
the Division has had but ten days in its new area.
Orders came in on the 28th and the regiments moved out on
the 29th, our headquarters being at Gendreville. On the
next day they moved to Viocourt, the 2nd and 3rd battalions
being at Courcelles. Major Lawrence came to see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
me at the hospital to tell me about the new move and I
obtained permission to leave and rejoin my regiment. I
shall always have a warm place in my heart for the doctors
and nurses of the Buffalo and Westchester County Units.</p>


<h3>VIOCOURT</h3>


<p class="right"><em>September</em> 1st, 1918</p>


<p>I walked into Division Headquarters at Chatenois today
on my business as Senior Chaplain. I sent off a couple of
telegrams to the G. H. Q. Chaplains about a Protestant
chaplain that I want them to send for the Alabamas and
also stirring them up about a Protestant chaplain that I
had been asking them for a long time for my own regiment.
Another telegram went to the K. of C. at Paris to send a
priest to look after Catholics in the Illinois and Indiana
artillery regiments, as the chaplains there are anxious to
have one. My final inquiry was about transportation to
Toul for Jewish members of the Division in order to have
them celebrate their approaching feast. Sergeant Marcus
looked up at me and grinned: “Say, Father Duffy, aren’t
you glad you have no Buddhists to look after?” He added
that the adjutant had a surprise in store for me.</p>

<p>He had—two official announcements, one, that the corps
commander had made me a major and the other that I had
been cited for the D. S. C. Being a Major has no particular
thrills to it, except no doubt when I come to sign my pay
vouchers; but there is no man living who can truthfully
say that it means nothing to him to receive the bronze cross
and red, white and blue bar of our Army. To everybody,
I think, the greatest satisfaction comes not from what it
means to himself but from the gratification it will give his
friends. Another feeling uppermost in my mind was one of
grateful affection for Colonel McCoy because I knew that
it was he who had recommended me both for the rank and
the distinction. I wrote to him “The British reward their
military heroes with a peerage, a pension, and a tomb in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
Westminster Abbey. You have gotten for me the American
equivalent for two of them—the distinction and the
emoluments—and it only remains for you to fix it up so
that I can have a tomb in St. Patrick’s Cathedral. All that
is necessary to give me a right to that is to make me
Archbishop of New York; Cardinal, if you insist. I never
knew you to fail in anything you went after so I shall consider
this matter as settled.”</p>

<p>We remained in Viocourt six days and then began our
journey north by night marches. The 4th of September
was spent in the Bois de Raidon. On the 5th of September
the whole regiment was together at Bulligny. On the
6th, still marching by night, we were at Foug, and September
7th found us at Boucq, where we spent two days.</p>

<p>Here we had the honor of a visit from the Commander
in Chief. General Pershing had come on for the ceremony
of presenting Distinguished Service Crosses to those who
had been cited in our Division, and the ceremony took place
in a field to the northeast of our village of Boucq. The
recipients from our Regiment were Lieutenant Colonel
Donovan, Major Reilley, who quite overshadowed me,
Captain Merle-Smith, Lieutenant William Spencer, Lieutenant
John J. Williams, Sergeant Frank Gardella, Corporal
John McLaughlin, Corporal Martin Higgins, and
Burr Finkle. Captain Ryan and others who had been cited
were still in the hospital, while others were of those who
had perished on the field. A complete list will be given
in another place.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br>
THE ST. MIHIEL OFFENSIVE</h2>
</div>

<p>The field orders for the attack on the St. Mihiel salient
were received on September 10th, the date not being specified.
Our division was to attack as part of the 4th U. S.
Army Corps of the 1st U. S. Army; and we were given
the honor of being made the point of the arrow which
was to pierce through the center of the salient along the
base of the triangle that was to be cut off. The 89th
Division was on our right and the 1st Division on our left,
with the 3rd in Army reserve.</p>

<p>Our Division was to be formed with both brigades
abreast, the 83rd being on the left of the 84th. The relative
places of regiments with regard to each other was to be
in the same order in which they fought at the Ourcq—from
left to right: Ohios, New Yorks, Alabamas and Iowas.
Each regiment was to have one battalion in the first line
and one in the second, the remaining battalions acting as
brigade or division reserves. Battery F, 149th F. A. was
to follow up with the infantry of our brigade after their
capture of the first position. The brigade had also the co-operation
of a battalion of our Engineers for road and
bridge work, one platoon of the first gas regiment and two
groups of French Schneider Tanks.</p>

<p>On the night of September 10th we moved forward to
the vicinity of Mandres, where we relieved elements of the
89th Division which were transferred further to the right.
Our headquarters on September 11th were at Hamonville,
not far from Seicheprey where the 26th Division had played
a savage game of give and take with the Germans when
they held the trenches last Spring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span></p>

<p>Copies were issued of the very elaborate plans which had
been prepared by Army Chiefs of Staff outlining with
great definiteness the part that each element of our Army
had to play in the work that lay ahead of them.</p>

<p>The men were encamped in a forest of low trees, a most
miserable spot. It had been showering and wet all the week
and we were living like paleozoic monsters, in a world of
muck and slime. The forest roads were all plowed by the
wagon wheels and when one stepped off them conditions
were no better, for the whole place was really a swamp. I
made my rounds during the afternoon and got the men together
for what I call a silent prayer meeting. I told them
how easy it was to set themselves right with God, suggesting
an extra prayer for a serene mind and a stout heart in time
of danger; and then they stood around me in a rough semi-circle,
caps in hand and heads bowed, each man saying his
prayers in his own way. I find this simple ceremony much
more effective than formal preaching.</p>

<p>When I got back to headquarters I found my own staff
very considerably increased. Father Hanley had come
back a couple of days before. The rumors of approaching
action were all over France, so, sniffing the battle from
afar, he got the hospital authorities to let him out and rejoin
his regiment for the coming fight. I kept Father Carpentier
attached to the regiment for the time being until I
could get the Protestant chaplain that I had been petitioning
for so long. Father Hanley still had a perceptible limp
and was moving around with the aid of a stick so I told
him that he would have to look after the hospital center
(<em>Triage</em>) while the fight was on, a commission that he took
with no good grace. To Father Carpentier I gave a roving
commission to look after Catholics in the Ohio and Alabama
regiments, a task for which his zeal and endurance
especially qualified him.</p>

<p>Now I found two more Chaplains on my hands—one
from the Knights of Columbus, Father Moran, an Irish
Priest, and one assigned to the regiment, Chaplain Merrill<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
J. Holmes of the M. E. Church. I liked him on sight and
we were not long in getting on a basis of cordiality which
will make our work together very pleasant. It was too late
to send the extra chaplains to other regiments as we were
even then getting ready to move forward into line, so I
decided to keep them all under my wing. I told the lieutenants
of the Headquarters Company that it would not be my
fault if they did not all get to Heaven because we had five
chaplains along. “Five Chaplains,” said Lieutenant Charles
Parker. “Great Heavens! there won’t be a thing left for
any of the rest of us to eat.”</p>

<p>The terrain which was to be the object of the attack of
our three divisions was completely dominated on the left
by the frowning heights of Mont Sec; and if they had been
held in force by the enemy artillery it would have exposed
our whole army corps to a flanking fire which would soon
make progress impossible. It fell to the 1st Division to
make their advance along the mountain side.</p>

<p>The ground over which we were to pass was for the most
part fairly level up as far as the twin towns of Maizerais
and Essey, to the left of which the Rupt de Mad made its
way through swamps at the base of the hill which was
crowned by these two villages. A number of woods dotted
the surface; one of them, the Bois de Remières, stood directly
in front of our advance. No Man’s Land at this point
was seven or eight hundred yards wide; and the German
trenches, as we afterwards found, were not in very good
condition, though there was plenty of wire standing both
here and at other points that were prepared for defence.
We were to jump off at the east of Seicheprey, and regimental
headquarters and dressing station were established
by Colonel Mitchell and Major Lawrence in the Bois de
Jury, not far to the rear.</p>

<p>We moved up to our jump-off point on the night of September
11th. The rain was falling in torrents. The roads
were like a swamp and the night was so dark that a man
could not see the one in front of him. And of course no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
lights could be lit. The road could not be left free for
the foot soldiers, but was crowded with ammunition wagons,
combat wagons, signal outfits and all the impedimenta
of war. Time and again men had the narrowest escapes
from being run down in the dark, and scarcely anybody
escaped the misfortune of tripping and falling full length
in the mud. It is a miracle of fate or of organization that
the units were able to find their positions on such a night,
but they all got where they belonged and found the lines
neatly taped by Colonel Johnson’s excellent body of engineers.
The 1st Battalion was in the front line commanded
by Lieutenant Colonel Donovan, who was not willing to
let his newly conferred rank deprive him of the opportunity
of leading his battalion in another fight. The 2nd battalion
under Major Anderson was in the second line, and
picked men from each of its companies were given the task
of following close behind the 1st, as moppers up, i. e., to
overcome points of resistance which might be passed over,
take charge of prisoners, etc.</p>

<p>The men shivered through the night in the muddy
trenches waiting in patient misery for morning and the
orders to attack. At 1:00 A. M. September 12th, our artillery
opened fire on the enemy. We had expected a night
of terrific noise like that which preceded the German offensive
on July 15th, but the present one was not nearly so
fierce, though it would have seemed a wonderful show if
we had not heard the other one. In July the guns on both
sides were shooting everything they had without cessation.
But, here, there was no enemy counter preparation fire and
our own fire was more deliberate.</p>

<p>Dawn broke on a cold, windy day and a cloud darkened
sky. Donovan had been moving up and down his line with
a happy smile on his face (unless he detected anything out
of order) telling the men: “There’s nothing to it. It will
be a regular walkover. It will not be as bad as some of
the cross-country runs I gave you in your training period.”
And when H hour arrived at 5:00 A. M., the feeling of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
men was one of gladness at the prospect of getting into
action.</p>

<p>Their way was prepared by a screen of smoke and a
rolling barrage delivered by our artillery. Tanks advanced
with our infantry crawling like iron-clad hippopotomi over
the wire in front to make a passage-way. Some of them
came to grief on account of the rain-softened ground, the
edges of a trench giving way under the weight of a tank
and standing it on its nose in the bottom. During the two
days of advance we were well supplied with aeroplane service
and possessed undoubted superiority in the air.</p>

<p>The four-inch Stokes Mortars had been put in position to
lay down a smoke barrage and the barrage began to pound
the enemy front line at the zero hour. The shells whistled
overhead much closer than they had done during the artillery
preparation and broke on the enemy trenches kicking
up red fire and black clouds where they hit. It was raining
slightly, there was a mist, and dawn was not yet breaking
when the machine gun barrage which took the men over
began to fire. The men began to whisper among themselves
“That’s our stuff; no it’s not, yes it is.” All the sounds of
battle were heard; the artillery, the small guns, and then,
a little too soon, the Stokes Mortars in front of the Alabamas
starting their fire-works which illuminated the entire
front when the thermite shells exploded.</p>

<p>Then everybody jumped and started forward. The
Bois de Remières lay in front of the right flank of our first
battalion and as they moved forward, the flank units gave
way to the left to pass around instead of through the woods.
For a moment they lost direction. The support companies
seemed to hesitate at the first belt of wire and began picking
their way rather too fastidiously through it. Lieutenant
Harold L. Allen was with the headquarters group which
consisted of a mélange of runners, pioneers, liaison men,
snipers, etc. He tells about Donovan running back from
the front line shouting to the men “Get forward, there, what
the hell do you think this is, a wake?” These words seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
to inspire Captain Siebert and as the lines moved forward
he shouted loud and profane encouragement to the machine
gun carriers burdened with boxes of ammunition and
struggling forward through the tangle of trenches and
broken wire.</p>

<p>Machine gun resistance was met on the enemy’s second
line. The assault waves deployed and began firing. Automatic
teams and snipers crawled forward to advantageous
positions. Donovan, with his usual disregard of danger
(never thinking of it in fact, but only occupied with getting
through), moved back and forth along the line giving directions,
and the enemy resistance did not last long, most of
their men surrendering. Donovan led his men at heart-breaking
speed over the hills, smashing all resistance before
them and sending in small groups of prisoners. St. Baussant
was taken at the point of the bayonet and the line swept
on. On the hill overlooking Maizerais the battalion was
halted once more by machine gun fire, and a battery of
artillery behind the village less than five hundred yards
away. The Germans had evidently decided to make some
sort of a stand, taking advantage of the hill and the protection
of the Rupt de Mad. But Donovan with about thirty
men jumped into the river, made his way across it under
fire, and when the Germans saw this determined assault
from their flank they threw up their hands and cried “Kamerad.”</p>

<p>They attempted further resistance near Essey where they
had machine gun pits in front of the village, but the resistance
was quickly reduced by the aid of a tank and the
village was cleared of the enemy. Donovan kept the battalion
in the stone walled gardens on the outskirts of the
town. Our own barrage was still pounding the village, for
Essey represented the objective of the “First Phase, First
Day,” and some of our men who wandered into town were
hit by flying stone from the walls of houses.</p>

<p>Prisoners began to come in and a prisoner park was established
near a big tree on the road leading into the village.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
French civilians were still living in this village, having spent
the period of bombardment in a big dugout—the first civilians
that we had the pleasure of actually liberating. They
laughed and wept and kissed everybody in sight and drew
on their slender stock of provisions to feed the hungry men.
The soldiers began wandering everywhere looking for souvenirs.
Corporal Kearin was in charge of the prison park.
All the captives were from the regiments of the 10th Division,
except a few from an attached Minenwerfer company
and an artillery regiment. They were eager for fraternization
and chatted and laughed with their captors. The
men of the support battalions and from the units on our
right and left, attracted by the town, began to straggle over.
It resembled a County Fair, the prisoner park being the popular
attraction of the day. Americans literally swarmed
around the prisoners in idle curiosity while others rummaged
through the German billets and headquarters looking
for pistols, maps, German post-cards and letters—anything
that would do for a souvenir.</p>

<p>However, this did not last long, Donovan had his battalion
out and going for the objective which was marked
as “Second Phase, First Day,” which lay beyond the next
town of Pannes; and Anderson, coming in with the bulk of
the 2nd Battalion, imposed his rigorous discipline on those
whose business it was to be in town. He certainly was not
loved for knocking in the head of a barrel of beer which
some of the fellows had found (and, by the way, there can
be no better proof of the rapidity with which the Germans
evacuated the town than the fact that they had left it behind).</p>

<p>Donovan met with further resistance when he arrived
before Pannes about one o’clock in the afternoon. He
called for artillery and tanks and filtered up his men along
the trees on the edge of the road while the Ohios advanced
on the left and the Alabamas make a flanking movement
against the town from its right. They soon had the opposition
broken and by 1:45 P. M. our advanced elements,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>widely extended, were proceeding from Pannes towards
the Bois de Thiaucourt, and at 1:55 the objective “Second
Phase, First Day” was occupied by the 165th Infantry.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="no-indent">AT QUENTIN ROOSEVELT’S GRAVE

</figure>

<p>The whole day it had been a wild gallop with occasional
breathing spells when the Germans put up some resistance.
From the rising ground around Essey men looked back,
and towards the west and east where the 1st and the 89th
were also moving forward. It was like a moving picture
battle. Tanks were crawling up along the muddy roads and
khaki colored figures could be seen moving about in ones
and twos and fours along the edges of the woods and across
the grassy plains. Toward the rear were passing ever
larger groups of prisoners in their blue gray uniforms,
carrying their personal belongings and in many cases their
own wounded as well as ours on improvised litters. Overhead
the shells were still screaming from our heavy artillery
with a good deal of answering fire from the German
batteries, which caused most of our losses.</p>

<p>The prisoners were mainly Austrians and Austrian Slavs.
They had not been very keen about the war at any time
and were made less so on finding that they had been left
behind after the bulk of the army had withdrawn. Many
of them had been in the United States, and the first question
that one of them asked was “Can I go back now to
Sharon, Pa?” One of them was found seated in a dugout
with a bottle of Schnapps and a glass. He immediately
offered a drink to his captor saying “I don’t drink it myself,
but I thought it would be a good thing to offer to an American
who would find me.”</p>

<p>During the afternoon of the 12th the brigade P. C. was
moved to Essey, regimental P. C. to Pannes. The 1st battalion
organized their position just south of the Bois de
Thiaucourt which was held by patrols who took more prisoners;
the 2nd battalion about 1,000 yards further back on
the reverse slope of a hill; and the 3rd battalion just outside
the town.</p>

<p>The next day’s task was still easier. Donovan’s men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
jumped off at 6:10 A. M. with Companies B and C in the
lead and A and D in support. Their patrols to the front
at the time reported no contact with the enemy. Major
Reilley with the 3rd Battalion was sent as Division Reserve
for the 1st Division but was later ordered back. The 1st
Battalion, followed by the 2nd, pushed through the Bois
de Thiaucourt and the Bois de Beney capturing a couple of
prisoners and meeting with no resistance. At the Sebastopol
Farm a woman told them that the Germans were just
ahead and retreating. The advance of our men was somewhat
delayed by a gun in our supporting artillery which
kept firing short and endangering the men, as one of the
greatest difficulties in a rapid advance such as was made at
St. Mihiel is that of maintaining liaison with the rear. By
half past nine they had captured the enemy’s supply depot
along the railway track, with the neighboring village of St.
Benoit and the Chateau St. Benoit. It was a foot race all
the way between the four infantry regiments and our fellows
claim they won it by a good half hour, but I haven’t
heard yet what the others have to say. I only know that
if I ever have to follow up our infantry again in such an
attack I am going to wait for an express train.</p>

<p>One thing that stands out most impressively in the memories
of the 165th regarding this action is the devotion and
courage of one of our former commanding officers. The
dugout where Lieutenant Colonel Donovan established his
temporary headquarters on the night of September 11-12th,
was very small and very crowded. Every officer commanding
a unit of the auxiliary arms crowded into it to avoid
the nasty drizzle and darkness outside. The room was full
of smoke, some of which managed to get outside as officer
after officer came in to report the position of his unit. It
was like the headquarters of an army corps. Parker of the
one-pound cannons was perched on the upper deck of a
bunk flanked by Siebert of the machine guns and a French
Lieutenant who had come in to report that the accompanying
tanks were ready. Lieutenants Allen and Betty were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
trying to carry out Donovan’s numerous orders. Captain
Stone of the 149th Field Artillery pushed his way into the
crowded room and reported to Donovan that his battery had
been detailed to roll forward with the assaulting infantry.
There was some conversation between them as to the conditions
of the roads near Seicheprey and the possibility of
having the battery follow close behind the assault, the number
of available rounds of ammunition with the guns and
the chance of delay in getting them forward over No Man’s
Land. The conversation continued for a few minutes and
was ended by Donovan saying, “Well, we have not done it
before but we’ll give it a whirl this time.”</p>

<p>Just then Major Lawrence opened the door and called
“Colonel, here’s an old friend of yours.” It was Colonel
Hine. Wet and muddy and tired but evidently delighted to
be back with the old regiment. Donovan gave him an enthusiastic
welcome as did all the rest, although Betty whispered
to Allen in a humorous grouch “I’ll bet Donovan will
want us to get a room and bath for him”—referring to
the Colonel’s practice of inviting everyone in to dinner or
to share quarters no matter where he was or what he might
have, and then putting it up to the staff to provide. Everybody
naturally thought that Colonel Hine had come to view
the battle from the regimental observation post on the hill
near the Bois de Jury but later in the night when they moved
down to the parallel of departure Colonel Hine was still
along, sharing the experiences of the rest of them, stumbling
into shell holes and tripping over barbed wire in the
darkness. When they went over in the morning he was
still there, and with the first wave; and all through that day’s
fight and the next, he fought along by the side of his old
men, who conceived an admiration for him in their loyal
souls that nothing will ever efface.</p>

<p>Colonel Hine had obtained leave from his duties in order
to satisfy his desire of going through a big battle with his
beloved 69th. It was a unique compliment to the regiment
itself. The regiment appreciates it as such, but it dwells<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
more on the soldierly ardor and high courage of its first
Colonel, who, though he had been transferred to less dangerous
duties, found his way back to us and fought as a volunteer
private in the regiment he had commanded. Such
deeds as this are set forth in the story-books of history as
an inspiration to the youth of the land.</p>

<p>In picking up stories of the fight I got one from Lieutenant
Allen which I have jotted down as he gave it to me.
“We came in front of Essey. Here there was a hill marked
on the aeroplane photographs and maps which were issued
before the attack as ‘Dangerous, go to the right and left.’
As we came over the top of this hill and advanced on its
forward slope the battalion drew machine gun fire from
the enemy guns disposed in pits in front of the village. I was
out in front in a shell-hole with two snipers. One of them
I sent back to Donovan with a message; the other began
firing on the enemy who now began to run back into the
village. In an adjoining shell-hole a few feet away, a soldier
from our battalion sold a German Luger Pistol to an
officer from some other regiment who had wandered from
his sector, for thirty-five francs. A French tank caught
up to us at this stage of the fight and moved down the hill
until it was in front of the shell-hole where I was. I
rapped on the side of his turret and called to the pilot, who
reversed the turret and while the bullets slapped the side of
his tank, opened the window. He was a dapper little
Frenchman with the ends of his moustache waxed in points,
and was clean and smiling. I gave him a target in front
of the town and he fired several round at a mass of retreating
Boches hurrying over the next hill. Opening the
window again, he smiled and said ‘How’s that?’ then he
went lumbering on.”</p>

<p>As the first battalion was making its advance during the
second day it was held up in front of Sebastopol Farm
by our own barrage which had not yet lifted. While waiting
there they saw a French peasant woman with a small
boy grasping her hand running through the shell fire from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
the direction of the farm. When questioned, she was in a
great rage against the Boches and reported that a battalion
of their troops had evacuated St. Benoit during the night.
She also gave the welcome information that there were
supplies of food in the farm and was very grateful to the
Americans for releasing her from four years of captivity.
She was the only woman that we saw actually on the battlefield
during the war.</p>

<p>When our fellows reached St. Benoit they found that
the Germans had started a fire in the Chateau, but it was
quickly extinguished. The church too, had been set on fire
and was beyond saving. When Jim Barry of C. Company
saw it blazing he shouted “Glory be to God, those devils
have burnt the church. Let’s see what we can save out of
it.” With Tierney and Boyle and others following after
he ran into the burning building and carried out statues
and candelabra which they deposited carefully outside.
Having finished their pious work they began to remember
that they were hungry. Barry took from his musette bag
some German potatoes which he had stored there in place
of grenades that had been used up in action, and said, “Well
we have done what we could, and now we’ve got a good fire
here, and we might as well use it.” They stuck the potatoes
on the ends of their bayonets and roasted them in the embers.
Just then another party came along with some bottled
beer that they had salvaged from the German supplies in
Pannes, so they picnicked merrily in the square in front of
the blazing temple.</p>

<p>It was well for all of us that the Germans had departed
so suddenly that they left supplies behind, because it was
an almost impossible task to get the kitchens and ration
wagons through, on account not only of the poor condition
of the roads but of the congestion of traffic. We never saw
a worse jam in the whole war than on the main road from
Seicheprey to Pannes—tanks, guns and caissons, ammunition
wagons, trucks, infantry trains, all trying to get forward
along one narrow road, and the whole line held up if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
a single vehicle got stuck; mounted men and foot soldiers
trailed along the edge of this procession often having to
flounder through the swamps of the Rupt de Mad.</p>

<p>The situation became dangerous towards evening of the
second day when a large squadron of enemy battle planes
swooped down on our own, and after the fiercest contest I
have ever seen in the air drove two of ours to earth and
regained the mastery. They did not, however, resort to
bombing, satisfying themselves with reporting conditions to
their own artillery. Our wagon train had a most uncomfortable
half hour as it passed along the road between Beney
and St. Benoit. Shell after shell came hissing towards
them, but luckily the German guns were firing just a trifle
short. If the shells had carried another fifty yards the train
would have been wiped out; but the drivers sat steady on
their boxes and kept the mules going at even pace until they
reached their destination.</p>

<p>Pannes had still a number of civilians, about thirty in
all, and all of them very old people or children, the able-bodied
ones having been carried off by the enemy. Those
remaining received their deliverers with open arms, and all
the old ladies insisted on kissing Lieutenant Rerat, very
handsome and blushing in his neat uniform of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">horizon-bleu</i>.
They had been rationed by the Germans during the four
years of occupation; none too well, but with enough to
keep them fit to work. They gave us all they had, and we
had an opportunity to get an idea of what German soldiers
got to eat. The bread was an indigestible looking mass on
the order of pumpernickel. The coffee was far from being
Mocha, but sugar seemed to be more plentiful than in
France. The Fall vegetables were not yet ripe but the fields
had been sown with potatoes, turnips, kohlrabi, and acres
and acres of cabbage. The French authorities gave orders
to have all civilians evacuated to the rear whether they
wanted it or not; and Lieutenant Rerat and I assembled
them with their pitiful little collection of belongings and
sent them back in ambulances.</p>

<p>It was a great place for souvenir hunting—pistols, spurs,
German post-cards, musical instruments—all sorts of loot.
I saw Bill Schmidt with a long steel Uhlan’s lance; while
Tom Donohue, true to his instincts, came by with no less
than four violins. Most of the men, of a more normal type
of soldier, passed up the musical instruments in search for
German sausages and beer. There were also vast amounts
of military stores and ammunition, as well as the field pieces
and machine guns which had been captured in the battle.</p>

<p>Major Lawrence thinks that five or six of his men deserve
a citation, for going out voluntarily under the leadership
of Sergeant Eichorn and James Mason to rescue a
wounded officer in another regiment. The Sanitary Detachment
is very happy because they not only have the Major
back but also three popular sergeants—Grady, Hayes and
Maher who for a time have been attached to the Ohios.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Clifford is enthusiastic about the courage of
Sergeant Gilgar of Company B who went ahead with five
men against an enemy position, manœuvred his party into a
position where he threatened the German rear, and then,
by putting on a bold front as if he had a whole company
behind him, frightened them into surrender and returned
to our line with thirty-two prisoners. Sergeant John
Mohr’s life was saved by the quickness of John Moran who
was just in time in killing a German who was trying to get
our veteran Sergeant.</p>

<p>Chaplain Holmes, who had walked into fight his very first
day at the front, was anxious to do his full share, and
volunteered while we were at Pannes to scour the battlefield
in order to bury the dead. Lieutenant Flynn and a detachment
from Headquarters Company went with him and
carried out this mournful task. At the time we had no way
of knowing for certain just how many of ours had fallen
on the field. The battlefield was in our hands from the
first and anyone who had a spark of life in him was carried
quickly to the rear. Later estimates placed the number of
our dead, up to the present, as about thirty-five. The highest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
in rank was Thomas J. Curtin, 1st Sergeant of Company
D, who was hit by a rifle bullet advancing at the head of a
platoon. In Company A we lost another good Sergeant,
William Walsh; and in the same company Corporals Patrick
Doolan, Patrick McDermott and John McDonald with
Privates Joseph Biskey and William Williams; in Company
B, Mechanic Henry Schumacher and Private N. W. Blackman,
Douglas Cummings, Humberto Florio, William Poole
and Dominic Zollo; in Company C, Privates John Nanarto,
Felix Curtis, Manfred Emanuelson, Thomas F. Petty and
Augustus Altheide; in Company D, Corporal Philip Greeler,
Privates Ferdinand Urban, Ernest E. Martin, Horace Musumeck,
William Mitchell, Walter Long, Clarence Gabbert,
with Corporal James MacDonald and Daniel Harkins (died
of wounds); Company E lost Corporals Michael Rooney
and William Bechtold; Company F, James Wynne, Rex
Strait, Eugene Rogers, Angelo Kanevas and Jesse Scott;
Company G, William Perkins; Company H, James Spiker
and Joseph Deese; Company K, Privates Joseph Dearmon,
G. C. Kenly and W. H. Leach, Company M; O. O. Dykes
and Edward Kiethley, while the Machine Gun Company
suffered the loss of John F. McMillan, Edward Hantschke
and Charles Brown. Lieutenant Boag was wounded.</p>

<p>The Chateau St. Benoit is a fine roomy building—a perfect
palace of dreams after the outlandish places that had
constituted our abodes. But every body in it has an uneasy
feeling that it makes a splendid target for enemy artillery.
Charles Carman said to me: “Any gunner that couldn’t hit
this building at night with his eyes shut ought to be sent
back to whatever the Heinies call their S. O. S.” They
have missed it however, and more than a few times; but
perhaps that is because they have still hopes of occupying
it. Three big 150’s came over last night and just missed
knocking off the corner of the building where General MacArthur
was sleeping. They landed in the stable and killed
some of our horses.</p>

<p>We are in for a considerable amount of shelling periodically.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
A high trajectory shell, like our American rattlesnake,
has at least the rudimentary instincts of a gentlemen.
It gives fair warning before it strikes, and a man can make
an attempt to dodge it; but the Austrian 88’s are mean all
the way through. It sounds Irish to say that you hear it
coming after it explodes, but that is literally true if it falls
short of you.</p>

<p>The whole sector has been pinched off by the operation
and we are now in touch with the French on our left, the
1st Division being crowded out by the operation, and the
89th Division still occupying the positions to our right. We
are faced now in the general direction of Metz, and the
Germans occupy the Hindenburg line as their line of defense.
Our main business has been to organize our newly
acquired positions and to throw out frequent patrols to test
out the enemy.</p>

<p>Colonel Donovan established his battalion headquarters
in the Forester’s House on the road to Haumont which was
the nearest village held by the enemy. Here Sergeant Moore
of B Company brought him a German prisoner whom he
had just captured. On interrogation he said that he was a
sentinel of a machine gun cossack post and that in the post
there was an officer and eight men including one non-com.
All of these he thought would be willing to surrender except
the officer and perhaps the N. C. O. Colonel Donovan
suggested that a rope be tied to the prisoner and that he
be compelled to guide a patrol to the outpost, but the German
protested that it was entirely unnecessary, as he was
willing to betray his comrades. A patrol was sent out which
captured the outpost and killed the officer, who, as predicted,
put up the only resistance encountered. Our patrol was delighted
at making the capture, but if a chance shot had
ended the career of the man who had betrayed his own
officer, no one amongst ours would have shed any tears.</p>

<p>Patrols from the 1st and 2nd battalions were sent out
frequently both by day and by night until September 17th.
Some prisoners were captured, and we had our own losses.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
In the first battalion a patrol of Company F came back without
Bernard Cafferty and Lawrence Whalen who put for
shelter with the rest, under withering German fire, and
are probably killed.</p>

<p>I have picked up a couple of stories which relieve a little
this sombre side of war. Lieutenant Ogle took out a patrol
one dark night and found in his party one soldier without
a rifle, for which he rebuked him in a savage whisper.
Later on he discovered that it was Father Carpentier who
had accompanied the patrol—he says to render spiritual
first aid if anyone was wounded. “Yes,” I said, “that’s
what the priest told the bishop: that he went to the horse
races so as to be handy if one of the jockeys were thrown.”</p>

<p>Allen likes to tell stories on Donovan, for whom he has
great admiration. One afternoon he came in from patrol
very hungry after being away since early morning, and he
dropped into Captain Buck’s shack near Hassavant Farm,
which was also occupied by Colonel Donovan. “Captain
Buck’s orderly promised me a roast beef sandwich and left
the room to prepare it. I repeat I was very hungry and
was anticipating with great pleasure the coming roast beef
sandwich. In a few minutes the orderly returned with the
food. It was a large sandwich with a luscious rare slice
of roast beef protruding from the slices of bread, and with
it the orderly brought a cup of coffee which he placed with
the sandwich on the table. Precisely at this moment a soldier
entered with two prisoners; one a small Roumanian
about sixteen years of age, and the other a tall, gaunt, dirty
looking soldier, both members of a labor battalion. They
had been lost in the retreat and had wandered several days
in the woods, until encountering one of our patrols they
had surrendered. Donovan grabs the sandwich with one
hand and the cup of coffee with the other. The small boy
got the sandwich and the old man the cup of coffee. I
immediately protested ‘Colonel,’ I said, ‘it is against regulations
to feed prisoners before they have been questioned
at Division. You should not feed these men.’ ‘Allen,’ he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
said, ‘you ought to be ashamed of yourself. This poor
little boy has been, wandering around in the woods for two
days with nothing to eat.’ ‘Besides,’ I said, ‘that was my
sandwich.’ ‘And you,’ he continued, ‘a great big healthy
man, would take his meal away from him.’”</p>


<h3>LA MARCHE</h3>


<p class="right"><em>September</em> 26th</p>


<p>On September 17th our regiment was relieved by the Alabamas
and the men were encamped altogether in the town
of La Marche, which consists of one large <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ferme</i> with a few
extra stone buildings and a number of wooden shacks which
were constructed by the Germans. In the big farm house
we are a happy party. Colonel Mitchell likes to have his
officers around him and they share his feelings to the full.
We have plenty of provisions, a good many of them German,
and Staff and Field Officers are messing together.
At table are Colonel Mitchell, Lieutenant Colonel Donovan,
Majors Reilley, Anderson, Kelly and Lawrence, Captain
Meaney, Adjutant, Captain Merle-Smith, Operations Officer,
Lieutenant Rerat, Lieutenant Spencer and myself. If
my fancy leads me to the open air I can walk down the
road to Pannes where Captain Mangan with Kinney and
Frank Smith are working away with their doughty mule-skinners,
unless perchance the German shells chase them
underground; or across the open field to the woods where
our men are leading a lazy though muddy existence.</p>

<p>Various incidents, amusing or tragical as is the way of
war, broke the comparative monotony of these ten days.
There was a captive observation balloon just outside the
village which evidently must have had a good view of the
enemy because they were most anxious to get it down. No
aeroplane succeeded in setting fire to it, so the Germans got
after it with long range guns. One afternoon the fire got
so hot that the chauffeur of the truck to which it was attached
started down the road to get out of range with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
big sausage still floating in the air at the end of its cable,
the Germans increasing their range as their target moved.
Sergeant Daly, the mess sergeant of the Machine Gun Company,
was peacefully crossing the field on a lazy going mule
unaware of what it was all about, when a German shell
aimed at the aeroplane down the road passed with the speed
and noise of a freight train about twenty feet above his
head. The mule gave one leap forward, and Daly was not
trying to stop him; and two thousand soldiers who had
been watching the flight of the balloon burst into a tremendous
laugh.</p>

<p>On the night of September 23rd, a large calibre German
shell made a direct hit right into a shelter pit in the woods
where five of the best men in our machine gun company
were lying asleep; Sergeant Frank Gardella, who had won
the D. S. C., Sergeant Harry P. Bruhn and Sergeant J. F.
Flint, with Privates H. McCallum and William Drake, who
was one of three brothers in the company. All five were
blown out of the hole by the concussion as high as the lower
branches of the trees. Sergeant Flint landed, bruised and
stunned, but untouched by the fragments. He gathered
himself together and found Gardella killed instantly and the
other three terribly wounded. He bound them up, calling
for help, which was brought by Lieutenant De Lacour, and
the three wounded men were gotten back to the hospital by
Major Lawrence and Captain Dudley, but we had little
hopes for them, and have since heard that they died of their
wounds.</p>

<p>Jim Cassidy, Frankie Maguire and Jimmy Kelly found
some German flour which they brought into the Headquarters
Kitchen. They are a guileless looking trio and I
cannot say to this day how deep a part they played in this
affair. They gave the flour to Joe De Nair. Now Joseph
Patrick De Nair has knocked around this world for more
years than he will acknowledge to anybody—long enough
at any rate, to have learned how to turn his hand to anything;
and he announced his intention of making pancakes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
for all hands, especially me. Everybody was set to work
under Joe’s direction. Fred Miller and Anderson salvaged
some molasses. Al Ettinger was hustled off on his motorcycle
to Pannes to use my name with Lieutenant Scheffler
for some oleo, of which we were short. Pat Sharkey rustled
wood; Frank Clason built a fire and John Brickley flattened
and polished a tin for Joe’s cooking. Bill Hanley and Humphrey
were appointed assistant chefs. There was a group
around me consisting of Proctor, Holt, Katz and Proudfoot,
and Joe came over: “All you ginks have got to work.
There are no guests around here except Father Duffy.”
I told him they had been reading an article in the “Daily
Mail” on the Irish question and were asking me about it.
That saved them, for Ireland counted more with Joe than
even the success of his pancakes.</p>

<p>The bustling preliminaries were finally completed and Joe
proceeded to make his batter. He poured it on the tin and
waited, turning-spoon in hand until, like St. Lawrence, it
should be done on one side. Then with the air of an
artist, he turned his first pancake with a flourish. It
landed on the pan with a bang like a shell striking an
elephant hut. “What the——,” muttered Joe, as he picked
up the results of his labor. “Well I’ll be——!” “What’s
the matter Joe?” I asked, conscious that something was
going wrong and that my presence deprived him of the
normal outlet for his feelings. “What’s the matter.
Where’s those dummed kids?” “Well, what is the matter?”
“What’s the matter. What’s the matter? The stuff they
gave me for flour is plaster of Paris. That’s what’s the
matter. Where the—— Oh for Heaven’s sake, Father, go
inside until I can let myself spill.”</p>


<h3>BOIS DE MONTFAUCON</h3>


<p class="right"><em>October</em> 10th.</p>


<p>On September 27th, we relieved the 84th Brigade in the
line, taking over the positions of the Iowas in subsector<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
Marimbois, Major Anderson’s battalion being in the forward
position. It was the usual business of patrolling until
September 30th, when our Division was relieved in the
Sector by the 89th, and withdrew to the Bois de la Belle
Ozière, a little south of where we were before. Next
morning, October 1st, we marched about 10 kilometers to
our embussing point, where we found a tremendously large
fleet of camions driven by the little Chinks whom our fellows
now call the undertakers, because they associate them
with deaths and burials.</p>

<p>Here I met an old friend, George Boothby of the New
York <cite>World</cite>, who had finally succeeded in getting over to
the war by entering the publicity department of the Y. M.
C. A. The uniform with the red triangle somehow caused
a smile when seen on George, but he was the first to grin.</p>

<p>We got started at four o’clock in the afternoon and
spent the whole of a freezing night on the journey, most
of it lying along the Voie Sacrée or Sacred Way, over which
the supplies and reinforcements had been sent which saved
Verdun. Our destination was Mondrecourt where we remained
until October 4th, when we marched by daylight
to Jubécourt. On October 5th we moved north again, an
interminable march, with all the infantry in the Division
going up on one mean road, to the woods of Montfaucon.</p>

<p>I had it easy myself because Colonel Mitchell with his
usual fine way of doing a courtesy, asked me as a favor to
get the automobile and some personal baggage through, as
he was going mounted. So Brown and Dayton and myself
got there by better roads ahead of the rest and found ourselves
at the headquarters of the 32nd Division, where Colonel
Callan and Father Dunnigan gave me a hospitable welcome.
When I heard “32nd Division,” my first thought
was “Now I can see McCoy again,” as he had been made
General of the 63rd Brigade, but it was two days before
I descried his familiar figure crowned with the French
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">casque</i>, a parting gift from the Comte de Chambrun when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
he left Chaumont. It was a memorable meeting, but all too
short, for he had his brigade in line to look after.</p>

<p>The woods of Montfaucon, which lie in the area of the
great battles for Verdun, fills exactly a civilian’s idea of
what No Man’s Land should look like. In its day it was a
fine forest of thick-girthed trees, but they had been battered
by long cannonading until not one of them was as nature
had fashioned it. Big branches had been torn off and heavy
trees knocked to the ground. The shell holes lay close together
like pock marks on a badly pitted face. It was
almost impossible to find a level spot to pitch a small pup
tent. Owing to recent rains and the long occupation of the
woods by troops, both our own and the enemy’s, the place
was in a bad state of sanitation. The roads, too, were bad
and difficult for all kinds of traffic, particularly motor
traffic. There were very few dugouts, all of them small
and most of them dirty and wet. Division headquarters
established itself in trucks as being better than any existing
accommodations. General Lenihan kindly took me in and
gave me a share in the dugout occupied by himself and
Lieutenant Grose. Together we made a happy week of it
in spite of bad conditions.</p>

<p>While here we received word that the Germans had asked
for an armistice. The older and wiser heads amongst us
felt quite certain that they would not get what they had
asked for until they were reduced to a more humble spirit;
but we were worried about the effect it might have on the
morale of the troops, because it would be particularly hard
for soldiers to face another big battle if they had made up
their minds that the fighting was over. So Colonels Mitchell
and Donovan asked me to go amongst the men, sound
them out, and set them right if necessary. It was an easy
commission. One of the first men I spoke to was Vincent
Mulholland, one of my parish recruits and now 1st Sergeant
of Company B. In answer to my first question he
replied “Of course I would like to see the war over, but
not while the old regiment is back here in army corps reserve.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
I want to see this war end with the 69th right out
in the front line, going strong.” Not everybody was as
emphatic as that, but I was able to make a very assured
report that the old timers at least would go into a battle
with the same spirit they had at Champagne or the Ourcq
or St. Mihiel.</p>

<p>Jack Mangan has left us to take charge of the organization
of the Headquarters Battalion of the new Second
Army at Toul. Colonel Haskell, who is assistant Chief
of Staff in the 2nd Army, visited us during our journey
from Baccarat to Chalons and got a great reception from
the old-timers. Even then, he had his eye on Mangan and
wanted him to come with him. There is nothing that so
much impresses me as a proof of the absolute sense of duty
and loyalty of our old officers to this regiment as the attitude
which they invariably take concerning invitations to
improve their rank and fortunes by going elsewhere. The
younger officers have no choice in the matter. We have
been sending home as instructors a few of them each month,
and have lost a large number of very efficient lieutenants.
But those who are free to exercise any choice invariably
view the opportunity as a question of conscience and put
the matter up to me. Major McKenna (then Captain) did
this in the Lunéville area when he had a chance for the office
of Judge Advocate. In the same spirit Mangan said he
would not quit to join Haskell unless I decided that the
Regiment could spare him. My decision was that he could
not go until Kinney was made a Captain, as I knew that
the latter could fill admirably the extremely important post
of R. S. O.</p>

<p>The hardest battle of all has been to keep Donovan with
the Regiment, but he has made that fight himself, as there
is no place else in the world that would tempt him for a
minute. He has dodged orders to send him to Staff College
(which would inevitably mean a transfer after he was
finished), orders to go on special duties, invitations or suggestions
to receive promotion by transfer. General Menoher<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
and Colonel MacArthur have been always alert to take
up the battle to retain him with us. He and I tramped the
muddy road tonight while he disburdened himself of a new
worry. The Provost Marshal General wants an assistant
who is at once a good lawyer and a keen soldier, with a
knowledge of French, and he has demanded that Donovan
be sent to him. Colonel Hughes, our new Chief of Staff,
has done his best to block it; but he has been informed by
General Headquarters that the authorities of the 42nd Division
have managed to evade the wishes of military authority
in Colonel Donovan’s case six times already and that this
order is peremptory. All that General Menoher has been
able to do is to hold him until the next battle is over.
Donovan is disgusted and sore for the first time in my
knowledge of him.</p>

<p>Every now and then there is some desultory shelling in
the woods, but the only sight of warfare that we get is in
the sky. Our balloons must be well placed, because the
German flyers have been very persistent in their attempts to
bring them down, and their efforts are too often successful.
Today, we saw a German aviator perform a feat which was
one of the most daring things that any of us has seen during
the war. The rapid and sustained discharge of anti-aircraft
guns (which have their own unmistakable note) brought
everybody to the edge of the woods. Guided by puffs of
white or black smoke which dotted the sky above us, we
were able to detect a single German plane headed unswervingly
towards us, and not flying very high either. Our own
planes were swooping towards him, but he came right on,
without any change of altitude or direction. He passed
over our line of balloons, and then turned abruptly and
dived towards the one nearest us, throwing his dart and
passing on. The flames did not show at once, and evidently
noticing this, he checked his flight and started back to finish
the job. Just then the flames burst up, and he wheeled in
air to make his escape. Soldiers in combat divisions are
the best sports in the world. There must have been twenty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
thousand of them watching this daring exploit of an enemy,
and I feel certain there was not a man amongst them who
did not murmur “I hope to God the beggar gets away.”
There were a dozen of our planes after him by this time
and before he reached his own lines they forced him to
earth, landing in safety.</p>

<p>As I make my rounds amongst the men scattered through
the woods, I find many whose names I do not know. In
the original regiment I knew practically everyone by his
name; but through a variety of causes half of those men
are no longer with us and their places have been taken by
others, with whom, on account of our constant motion, it
has been impossible to get acquainted.</p>

<p>The wearing down of a regiment, even outside of battle,
is constant. Brigade and Division Headquarters select
those that they want for their own work, bright sergeants
are sent off to Army Candidate’s School to be trained for
officers, and are invariably sent to other divisions. There
is a constant trickle of sick men to hospitals, from which
many never return to us; and most of all, there are the
tremendous losses that a regiment, particularly an infantry
regiment, has to pay in battle. Our total losses in action
of killed, wounded and missing up to the present are about
2,600 men. Taking all causes into consideration nearly
3,000 of our original men have been dropped, at least
temporarily, from our rolls since we came to France. If
none of them had returned there would be now only 600
of them left, but as a matter of fact, nearly all of our
wounded who have graduated into the “Fit for Service”
class have insisted on their right to come back. So about
half of our present total of 2,983 men are of the original
outfit. It is easy to pick them out by glancing down a company
roster, because our serial numbers are all under
100,000 while the new men have numbers running into the
millions.</p>

<p>I do not find that the spirit of the regiment as a whole
has changed on account of these fresh accessions. A regiment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
is largely what its officers and non-coms make it.
Practically all of our present officers have been through all
the fights with us and have gained their present ranks in
battle, and the non-coms are naturally men of the original
regiment who have earned their stripes by good soldiering
in camp and in the field. These men are the custodians of
regimental pride and regimental tradition, and their spirit is
communicated to or imposed upon the newcomers.</p>

<p>Most of these newcomers moreover, have proved themselves
excellent material. The first few that were sent us
in Lunéville were poor foreigners from the coal mining
districts who could scarcely speak English, but in Baccarat
we got three hundred men from Camp Devens who were
a fine lot of fellows, and, now that they have gone through
the big fights with us, are not to be distinguished in any way
from the original volunteers. We received a lot of first
class men also from the Kentucky-Tennessee and the Texas-Oklahoma
National Guard organizations, among the latter
being a number of Indians. All of these replacements who
have gone through battles with us are now absolutely part
and parcel of the 165th Infantry and have created bonds of
battle friendship with our Irish and New York lads which
are closer than any family tie can be.</p>

<p>In any extended campaign it is a very rare soldier who
does not get the experience of being in a hospital at least
once; although we could not possibly spend as much time
in them as rumors that they get at home make our people
think we do. I myself have been killed or wounded at least
a dozen times. The other day Lester Sullivan, who comes
from my parish, looked up from a letter he was reading
and said to me “Father Duffy if you had ten thousand dollars
insurance for every time you were killed you’d never
need to work for the rest of your life.”</p>

<p>After battles of course they are being sent back by hundreds
and thousands. Jim Healey was telling me a yarn
which hits off a type of humor that is characteristic of the
American. A hospital train pulled into a French station<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
with its doors and windows and platforms crowded with
“walking cases” and stopped on a track alongside a similar
train with the same kind of a crowd looking out. “Where
are youse guys from?” shouted one of the soldiers. “Fohty-second
Division. Whey you all from?” “De rest of de
Forty-second Division” came the reply—everybody shouting
with laughter at this bit of delicate and tender humor.</p>

<p>Hospitals thus become, like London coffee houses in the
18th century, the clearing houses of news and the creators
of public opinion. They are the only place where soldiers
meet men who do not belong to their own Division; in
fact, soldiers seldom meet anybody outside their own regiment
and many a man’s friendships do not extend beyond
his company. But in hospitals, and more particularly in
convalescent and casual camps, where they are able to move
around, they come into touch with the whole American
Expeditionary Force. Battles are discussed, organizations
criticized, reputations of officers made or unmade.</p>

<p>It is in these places also that the sentiment for one’s own
Division grows strong. Regiments may fight with each
other within the Division, but as opposed to other Divisions
they present a united front. The regulars and marines in
the famous 2nd Division have their own little differences,
but they do not show when they come up against men from
the 1st, 26th, or 42nd. Our own New Yorks and Alabamas
started off with a small family row at Camp Mills which
has been utterly forgotten, partly because they have always
been fighting side by side on every battle front and have
grown to admire each other, but even more, I suspect, because
they have formed ties of blood brotherhood back in
convalescent camps by getting together to wallop the marines.</p>

<p>Every soldier in a combat division thinks that his own
division is doing all the work and getting none of the credit.
But then I never met a soldier yet who does not say “It’s a
funny thing that my platoon always happens to get the dirty
details.” This much is true—that there is a number of divisions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
which can be counted on the fingers of one’s two
hands that have been kept right up against the buzz-saw
ever since last June. Of course we are not proper judges of
the policies or exigencies of the high command, but everybody
who is in touch with men knows that they would be
better fitted for their work in the line if they could be taken
out for a few weeks rest. The discomforts and anxieties
of life at the front are cumulative, and men gradually get
fretful and grouchy as well as run down physically. It
is surprising to see how quickly they recuperate in a rest
area. We ought to be taken out of these woods to some
more civilized place where the men can go on leave or hang
around billets, writing letters, reading, cleaning equipment
and forgetting all about battle and bloodshed, and getting
freshened up mentally and physically. As one fellow said
to me “I’d like to get somewhere where I could hear a hen
cackle and see a kid run across the road. I’d like to be
where I could get a change from corn-willie by going off
some evening with a few of the fellows and getting some
old French lady to cook us up some oofs (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">oeufs</i>) and
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pommes frites</i>, with a bottle of red ink to wash it down.”</p>

<p>We knew that there had been going on for three weeks
now a battle for the possession of all this Argonne District,
in which many American Divisions were taking part, and
amongst them our sturdy fellow citizens from New York,
the 77th Division, who had succeeded us at Baccarat and
in the Château Thierry Sector. We expected that we would
be called upon to relieve the 32nd Division which was fighting
just in front of us. But today, October 10th, came
orders to proceed to the west along the river Aire for the
relief of the 1st Division.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX<br>
THE ARGONNE OFFENSIVE</h2>
</div>

<p>In the general operation which was shared in by all the
Allied armies in France to turn the German retreat into a
rout, the most difficult and most important task was assigned
to the Americans. The Belgians, British and French
could only exercise a frontal pressure on the enemy except
for a few local salients which might be created here and
there. But if the American army could smash their resistance
on the southeast end of the German lines, and
particularly if it could break through so as to capture the
military trunk line which ran through Sedan to their depot
at Metz, large bodies of Germans farther to the west would
be brought close to the point of surrender. Naturally, the
German Commanders knew this as well as Marshal Foch
or General Pershing and they massed their defenses at the
point of greatest danger. To the civilian mind, when troops
are advancing ten or fifteen kilometers a day and capturing
prisoners and guns, they are heroes of tremendous battles.
But soldiers know that in the tremendous battles an advance
of two or three kilometers is a big gain, to be paid for at a
great cost of human life. We had an example of the first
kind at Saint Mihiel, which loomed large in the imagination
of the folks at home, but which to the soldiers was a walkover.
The Argonne was no walkover during the first five
weeks.</p>

<p>The nature of the country made it easy to defend, hard
to capture. It is a hilly country—and that always means
plenty of woods. The hills, moreover, connect themselves
up in a general east and west direction and the advance had
to be made by conquering a series of heights. When we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
went into the fight the line-up of Divisions nearest to us
were the 77th, on the extreme left, going up through the
forest, the 82nd on the other side of the Aire, the 1st, which
we relieved, and on our right, the 32nd. Further east were
other divisions extending up to the Meuse, while yet other
bodies of Americans were working to cross that river and
fight their way up its eastern bank.</p>

<p>In the sector on the east side of the Aire, which we now
took over, the 35th Division had been first to go in. At
great sacrifice it had captured successive villages and ridges,
but had finally been repulsed on the last hill before reaching
Exermont and had been forced to fall back. Then the old
reliables of the 1st Division, who had been our first troops
to arrive in France and the first to engage with the enemy
at Cantigny, were called upon to do their share. They did
it, and more than their share. They captured the ridges
up to Exermont and Fleville and Sommerance, swept the
Germans off the Cote de Maldah and there established their
lines at the price of half the infantry in the Division.</p>

<p>Now it was our turn. If the others had a hard task, ours
was certainly no easier, because it was given to us to break
the final and long prepared line of German defenses, called
the Kriemhilde Stellung.</p>

<p>We marched to our new positions on October 11th, our
strength at the time being 53 officers and a little less than
3,000 men. Regimental headquarters were set up at Exermont,
the Supply Company being down the road at Apremont.
The first day the support and reserve battalions were
in a wide gully to the east, called Chaudron Farm. The 3rd
battalion effected the relief on the front line, Major Reilley
commanding, Lieutenant Heller, Adjutant, Company I under
Captain Michael J. Walsh, who had insisted on giving
up the Headquarters Company and taking a line Company
so that he could take part himself in the fighting; Company
K under Lieutenant Guignon; Company L, Captain Given,
Company M, Captain Rowley. In support was the 1st Battalion
now commanded by Major Kelly, Lieutenant O’Connor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
Adjutant, Lieutenant Connelly being Intelligence Officer.
The commanders of A, B, C, and D, being Lieutenant
W. Hutchinson, Lieutenant Clifford, Captain Bootz and
Captain Buck. Second Battalion under Major Anderson,
Lieutenant Fechheimer, Adjutant, with E, F, G and H
under Captain Conners, Captain Marsh, Captain Stout and
Lieutenant Ogle.</p>

<p>As the companies marched up to take their place in line
I stood on a rising ground in the bleak and open plain to
perform my own duties in their regard, which for many of
them would be the last time. The frequently recurring
rows of rude crosses which marked the last resting places of
many brave lads of the 1st Division were an eloquent sermon
on death; so that no words of warning from me were needed
and I was able to do my holy business in a matter of fact
way which soldiers like better than being preached at. General
Lenihan is fond of quoting Private Terence Mulvaney’s
remark: “What I like about the old church is that she’s so
remarkable regimental in her fittin’s.”</p>

<p>In former days men massed together for battle; today
they scatter. It is interesting to watch the deliberate disintegration
of a Division as it approaches the front line. It
breaks into brigades and into regiments for convenience in
using the roads. Then the regiments are broken into battalions,
usually, according to the stock phrase “echeloned in
depth” that is, one on the line, one in support and one in reserve.
The battalion breaks up into companies as it gets
nearer the front; and the companies, when they reach the
point where they are likely to be under shell fire, separate
into platoons with considerable distance between them. In
action men advance with generous intervals between.</p>

<p>When they get close to the enemy the advance is made by
frequent rushes, about a fourth of the men in a platoon running
forward, taking advantage of the ground, while their
comrades keep the enemy’s heads down by their fire, until all
of them can get close. In its last stages the warfare of these
small groups is more like the Indian fighting in which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
first General of our Republic learned the profession of arms,
than anything which the imagination of civilians pictures
it. To take machine gun nests—I am not speaking of regularly
wired and entrenched positions which it is the business
of artillery to reduce before the infantry essays them—it is
often a matter of individual courage and strategy. Sometimes
the fire of a platoon can reduce the number of the gunners
or make the less hardy of them keep their heads down
so that the pieces cannot be properly handled; but often the
resistance is overcome by a single sharp-shooter firing from
the elbow of a tree, or by some daring fellow who works his
way across hollows which are barely deep enough to protect
him from fire, or up a gully or watercourse, until he is near
enough to throw hand grenades. Then it is all over.</p>

<p>Our supply company and band were stationed at the
Ferme de l’Esperance on the Aire River. Going north
along the river road as far as Fleville one finds a road going
to the right through a deep defile which leads to the village
of Exermont about a mile and a half away. On the north
and on the south the view is bounded by steep hills which
have been captured by the 1st Division. To the north a
muddy trail winds around the base of hill 247 leading to a
wide, rough, partly wooded plain. This was covered with
the bodies of the brave soldiers of the 1st Division, more
thickly than I have seen anywhere else with the exception of
the hill where lay our 3rd Battalion north of the Ourcq.
There were many German wooden shelters at the base of the
hill to the right, with bodies of dead Germans, many of
them killed in hand to hand conflict.</p>

<p>Our 3rd Battalion took over the front line on the Cote de
Maldah, a maze of woods and ravines. Companies M and
I were on the twin knolls of the Cote, K and L in the
woods behind. To their left were the Ohios at Sommerance,
while the Alabamas and Iowas held positions similar
to our own on hills 263 and 269. Our 2nd Battalion was in
a shrubby woods to the rear, and the 1st Battalion was originally
held under protection of the hill just outside of Exermont,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
in which town were the headquarters of the 165th and
166th and the Regimental Dressing Stations of the 165th
and 167th. Our artillery, which had been in support of the
32nd Division, rejoined us on October 13th, making a hard,
forced march with animals that had been reduced in strength
and numbers by our continuous warfare. Colonel Henry
Reilly, a West Point graduate, and a man of great intelligence
and force of character, was appointed to direct the
operations of the artillery brigade, leaving Lieutenant Colonel
Redden to take charge of his own regiment, the 149th
Field Artillery. The artillery of the 1st division also remained
to assist in the sector.</p>

<p>The German main line of defense—the Kriemhilde Stellung,
was about three kilometers in front of our brigade but
less than two in front of the 84th Brigade. It was a well
prepared and strongly wired position consisting of three
lines of wires and trenches. The first rows of wire were
breast high and as much as twenty feet wide, all bound
together in small squares by iron supports so that it was
almost impossible for artillery to destroy it unless the whole
ground were beaten flat. Back of this were good trenches
about four feet deep with machine gun shelters carefully
prepared. Behind this front line at thirty yards intervals
they had two other lines with lower wire and shallower
trenches. Starting from our left these trenches ran from
west to east on our side of two small villages called St.
Georges and Landres et St. Georges. From in front of the
latter village the wire turned in a southeasterly direction
towards us, following the lowest slope of the Cote de Chatillon
and embracing LaMusarde Ferme, thence swinging
east again to take in the Tuilerie Ferme. The Cote de Chatillon
was a high wooded knoll which commanded the terrain
to west and south.</p>

<p>The task of the 84th Brigade was to work their way
through the Bois de Romagne and capture the two
farms and the Cote de Chatillon. Our brigade front was
of a different character, and with its own particular kind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
of difficulty. The terrain was the most nearly level section
we had seen in this country, and was mostly open, though
with irregular patches of woods. From the Cote de Maldah
it sloped off towards the north to a small brook that ran
in a general east to west direction through ground that
was a bit swampier than the rest; and from there, rising
gradually, up to the German wire. A good road with a
bridge over the brook ran northeast and southwest between
Sommerance and Landres et St. Georges. At the beginning
it lay entirely in the Ohio sector but our advance to
the north would bring us astride of it.</p>

<p>Our attack had to be made over open ground with the
purpose of carrying by direct assault wired entrenchments.
It was the warfare of 1916 and 1917 over again, and
everybody knows from the numerous British and French
accounts of such action that it can be accomplished only by
tremendous artillery preparation, and that even then gains
must be made at a great loss of Infantry. But a glance at
the maps, in which blue dotted lines represented the enemy
wire, showed us that we had greater danger to fear than
the resistance which would come from our direct front.
The blue dots ran straight across the right of the Ohio front
and all of ours, and then swung in a southerly direction for
a kilometer or more. They prophesied eloquently to anyone
who had the slightest knowledge of war that our main
danger was to come from our right flank unless that hill
could be taken first. Donovan’s desire was to advance until
we would be on a level with the wire to our right, hold that
line with a sufficient number of troops to guard against
counter attack, and throw in our main strength on the left
of the 84th Brigade, they striking from the south and we
from the west until the Cote de Chatillon should be taken.
Continuing the advance from there, we could take Landres
et St. Georges from the east. The orders however were
to attack, head on, with four regiments abreast. The 84th
Brigade was given three hours start to fight their way
through the southernmost German defences. It was calculated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
that they could get far enough forward during this
time so that both brigades could keep advancing in even line.</p>

<p>Preparations for the assault were made difficult by
weather conditions. The sun never shone and a large part
of the time it rained steadily. It was difficult to observe
the enemy lines or their troop movements from balloons,
and the advantage of aeroplanes was theirs—not ours. The
abominable condition of the roads made it impossible to get
sufficient ammunition forward and our artillery was working
under a great handicap. Facilities for communication with
the front line were poor throughout the whole action. The
wire, strung along the wet ground, was all the time getting
out of order; horses were few and runners had to make
their way back through seas of mud, which also caused
untold difficulty in getting forward food and ammunition.</p>

<p>However, everything was planned as well as possible
under the conditions. It was arranged to have tanks to
help our men get through the wire. The gas and flame
Engineers were also to render assistance, and Colonel Johnson
sent detachments of his Engineers (for whom I have
supplied a motto from an old song: “Aisy wid the Shovel
and Handy with the Gun”) to go with the Infantry as wire-cutters,
and to follow up to repair roads.</p>

<p>During the two days in which these plans were being
made the battle activity on both sides was conducted mainly
by the artillery. Company G had barely occupied its position
in the woods on the evening of October 11th, when it
was subjected to a heavy shelling, with the loss of M. Black
killed and Sergeant Edward McNamara, Corporal Framan,
Kessler, Dan McSherry and William McManus wounded.
Young Jim Gordon of Company E was running for a litter
to carry off the wounded when a fragment from a gas shell
struck him in the chest and killed him instantly. Arthur
Brown of Company I was killed on the Cote de Maldah.
Early on the morning of the 12th the men of Company C
who were lying along the southern bases of the hill not far
from a battery of artillery which the enemy were trying to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
get, had some shells dropped amongst them and H. Harbison,
L. Jones and Frank Foley were killed and Gorman
and others wounded.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Colonel Donovan was assigned by Colonel
Mitchell to have general charge of the situation at the front
while he with Captain Merle-Smith as operations officer and
Captain Meaney as Adjutant, handled it from the P. C. in
Exermont. Lieutenant Lawrence Irving, in charge of the
Intelligence Section, was at the observation post.</p>

<p>Our artillery preparations for the assault were begun at
3:30 on the morning of October 14th. Our brigade, in touch
with the 82nd Division on our left, jumped off at 8:30 in
the same morning. In our regiment Companies I and M
were in advance, with K and L in immediate support, a company
of the Wisconsin Machine Gunners being with them
and our 2nd Battalion supplying details for carrying ammunition,
etc. The front wave had not gotten well started
before it was evident that the enemy were expecting an attack,
and from the beginning our men went forward through
steady shell fire which increased as their purpose became
more clearly manifested. Two enemy aeroplanes flew along
the lines of our Division discharging machine guns and no
doubt keeping their own artillery posted on the results of
their fire. But, in spite of losses, our men kept going forward,
stimulated by the encouragement of Major Reilley
and his Company Commanders Walsh, Guignon, Given and
Rowley. They had about two miles to go before reaching
the enemy’s wire.</p>

<p>Captain Rowley with Company M was to the left alongside
of the Ohios and Captain Michael Walsh to the right,
and at the beginning in touch with the Alabamas, a touch
which was soon lost, as the latter regiment came to close
grips with the enemy at a point further south than our point
of attack, and our companies pushing northward found it
difficult to maintain liaison with them. The amount of time
assigned to the 84th Brigade to capture Hill 288, the Tuilerie
Farm, and the defenses at the base of the Cote de Chatillon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
was not sufficient for the magnitude of the task that was
given them to accomplish. By noon their line had passed
Hill 288 and was close to the enemy outposts, but at that
time our Brigade was already at their Second Objective.
From the outset the most destructive fire we had to undergo
came from machine guns firing from this Cote to our right
and enfilading our whole line; and the further forward we
got the more destructive it became. By 1 o’clock half of the
third battalion had been killed or wounded. Colonel Donovan,
with Lieutenants Wheatley and Betty, and Major
Reilley with Lieutenant Heller and Sergeant Courtney, were
all over the field sustaining the spirits of the men.</p>

<p>There is no tougher experience than that of advancing
over a considerable distance under fire. The trouble is that
the men are being shot down by an enemy whom they cannot
see. They reply with their rifles and machine guns, but
have only the vaguest hope that they are accomplishing anything
more than disconcerting their opponents. When a
soldier gets where he can see the foe he develops a sort of
hunter’s exhilaration. His blood warms up and he actually
forgets that the other fellow is shooting at him. Advancing
in the open against trenches he has only the sensations
of the hunted. Heavy fire begins to rain around them, men
are hit, the line drops, each man in whatever shelter he
can find. Then the order is given to rise and go forward
again; spurts of dust are kicked up, the first three or four
men to advance walk into the line of bullets and go down
before they have gone ten feet. And the others who have
seen them fall must go straight ahead and take that same
deadly chance, never knowing when they themselves will
stop a German missile. It takes undaunted leadership and
tremendous courage to keep going forward under such conditions.</p>

<p>That leadership the men possessed in their battalion commander
and those under him. Captain Rowley, a quiet, determined
man, kept M Company moving forward until he
was knocked senseless by a tree which was blown down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
upon him through the explosion of a shell. His place was
taken by Lieutenant Collier, who was shortly afterwards
also wounded, and Lieutenant Don Elliott found himself in
command. Company I was led by Captain Mike Walsh until
he received a long tearing wound through the arm. He
left his Company under command of Lieutenant Roderick
Hutchinson, who led the company until he too was
wounded, and started back alone to the Dressing-Station
under the slope of the hill, to have his wound bandaged up.
On his way back to the line he was hit once more and instantly
killed. Nobody knew that he was killed until his
body was discovered by Edward Healy, who buried him;
and was shortly afterwards killed himself. It was well for
his Company that they did not know the misfortune they
had sustained because no loss in our whole campaign was
more deeply felt than that of this rugged, whole-souled soldier
and leader of men. Companies L and K, under Captain
Given and Lieutenant Guignon, were also having their
troubles, especially Company K under the daring leadership
of its youthful commander. In all of the companies there
was great loss amongst our old time non-coms as they
moved around looking after the men instead of taking shelter
with them.</p>

<p>But the outstanding figure in the mind of every officer
and man was Lieutenant Colonel William J. Donovan.
Donovan is one of the few men I know who really enjoys a
battle. He goes into it in exactly the frame of mind that
he had as a college man when he marched out on the gridiron
before a football game, and his one thought throughout
is to push his way through. “Cool” is the word the
men use of him and “Cool” is their highest epithet of praise
for a man of daring, resolution and indifference to danger.
He moved out from the Cote de Maldah at the beginning
of the attack with his headquarters group, just behind the
supporting companies—his proper place, though he had no
intention of remaining there if he could do more efficient
work further forward. He had prepared himself for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
task he had determined on in a characteristic way. Instead
of taking off all signs of rank, as officers are supposed
to do to avoid being made a mark for sharp-shooters,
he had donned a Sam Brown belt with double shoulder
straps, so that none of his men could miss knowing who he
was; that the enemy also would pick him out was to him a
matter of serene indifference. As soon as the advance began
to slow up under the heavy losses, he passed to the front line
of the leading elements. The motto of the Donovan clan
must be “Come on.” It was “Come on, fellows, it’s better
ahead than it is here,” or “Come on, we’ll have them on the
run before long,” or with his arm across the shoulder of
some poor chap who looked worried, “Come on, old sport,
nobody in this Regiment was ever afraid.” He would stand
out in front of the men lying in shell holes into which he had
ordered them, and read his map unconcernedly with the
Machine-gun bullets kicking up spurts of dust around his
feet; and would turn smilingly, “Come on now, men, they
can’t hit me and they won’t hit you.” It was more like a
Civil War picture than anything we have seen in this fighting
to watch the line of troops rushing forward led by their
Commander.</p>

<p>But their task was more than any battalion could perform.
The conditions on the right made it impossible to
reach the wire in front with strength enough to break
through it. The 84th Brigade was doing heroic work, but
it was to take two days more of tremendously hard fighting
for them before the Cote de Chatillon could be reduced.
The nature of the fighting turned their front obliquely in
a northeast direction, while our Brigade was advancing due
north. Major Norris of the Alabamas filled in the gap between
our right and their left during the afternoon, thus insuring
against an attack from the Germans which might
break through our line. Their brigade captured Hill 288
that day but was held up in front of the Tuilerie Farm. It
was not until the evening of the 16th and by continuous and
desperate fighting that our gallant brothers of the 84th Brigade<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
pounded their way to the crest of the Cote de Chatillon.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, after six hours of battle, Donovan reported
that the 3rd Battalion, which had gotten up to the
slopes under the German wire, was too badly shot up to be
able to push through. He requested an artillery barrage of
an hour and a half to keep the Germans distracted while he
withdrew the 3rd Battalion carrying their wounded, through
the 1st Battalion under Major Kelly, who would take their
place. At dusk Kelly made his advance by infiltration,
Company C on the left, Company D on the right. The men
stole forward, losing heavily but taking advantage of every
inequality in the surface of the ground. Towards the right
of our position a rough wagon road run up through a draw
between two gradual slopes and just before it reached the
main road between Sommerance and Landres it passed
through a deep cut, in some places eight feet deep, part of
which was included in the enemy’s wire defenses.</p>

<p>The battalion fought its way right up to the enemy’s wire,
only to find it an impassable barrier. Our artillery fire had
not made a break in it anywhere, as for lack of aeroplanes
to register the effects of their work they had been shooting
entirely by the map. Groups of our lads dashed up to the
wire only to be shot down to the last man. Some ran
through a passage made for the roadway, the only possible
method of getting through, but this of course was absolutely
covered by the German guns, and every man that
went through it was shot and, if not killed outright, taken
prisoner. Soldiers of ours and of the Engineers with wire-cutting
tools lay on their faces working madly to cut through
the strands, while riflemen and grenadiers alongside of them
tried to beat down the resistance. But they were in a perfect
hail of bullets from front and flank, and every last
man was killed or wounded. Further back was a concentration
of artillery fire, of bursting shells and groans and
death, that made the advance of the support platoons a veritable
hell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span></p>

<p>The attackers finally fell back a short distance to the
deep cut in the road. Our second attempt to break through
had failed. Major Kelly with Lieutenant Connelly and
parts of companies A and C held this place as a vantage
point to make a third attempt in the morning. Bootz was
in charge on the left of the main road. About one hundred
and fifty yards south of the wire the ground sloped, and on
this reverse slope Colonel Donovan established his P. C.,
with Lieutenant Betty as his adjutant, Wheatley having been
wounded. With him also were detachments from the Headquarters
and Machine Gun Companies under Lieutenant
Devine and Sergeants Sheahan, Heins, Leo Mullin, Doherty
and Gillespie. During the night, accompanied by Sergeant
Major Bernard White, the Colonel himself scouted up to the
enemy wire to examine the conditions for the next days’ attack.
Tanks were promised to roll through the wire, shoot
up the machine gun nests and make a passage for the infantry.
Morning came but no tanks in sight. Lieutenant Grose
and Boberg and Brosnan of Brigade Headquarters were
scouring the roads in search of them. It took two hours
to get a message back, as the telephone was out. The artillery
barrage ran its appointed course and still no tanks.
Kelly once more made his attack, under conditions that he
soon discovered to be impossible for success. Every man
that reached the wire was hit, and losses were heavy in his
elements further back.</p>

<p>About half an hour after the advance began a rifle bullet
struck Colonel Donovan in the leg, going through the bone
and rendering him helpless. He would have ordered anybody
else to be evacuated, but he refused to allow himself
to be removed. In answer to the protests of his Adjutant
he swore he would stay there and see the thing through. So
he lay in his shell-hole and continued to direct the battle.
It was bound to be a one-sided one until the tanks should
come up. Our men in the sunken road were being shelled
by trench mortars which dropped their shells into the narrow
cutting, spreading disaster. Our elements in the more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
open ground to the rear were under continuous shell fire as
the enemy artillery had the exact ranges.</p>

<p>One of the creepiest feelings in war is that of being boxed
in by artillery fire. A shell lands to the right of a group
of men; no harm in that—all safe. Then one lands to the
left, to front, or rear, and the next is closer in between them.
Then everybody knows what is happening. That square is
in for a shelling until nothing living inside it will escape
except by miracle. This was the experience of many a group
that morning, and Colonel Donovan and his headquarters
men had to undergo it to the utmost. There always has to
be a good deal of motion around a Post of Command, so this
slope was made a special target. Shells fell all over it, and
men were blown out of their holes by direct hits. Thus perished
Patrick Connors of Company H and Color Sergeant
William Sheahan, one of the finest and bravest of men.
Donovan (and Major Anderson, who had come up and was
lying in the same hole with him) escaped without further
injury. Messages which had to be carried the short distance
between his shell-hole and where Kelly was were sent
with difficulty, many runners being killed or wounded. They
had no direct connection with the rear. It was a lone fight,
but both Donovan and Kelly were of the same mind, not
to desist from the attack so long as any chance remained of
putting it through.</p>

<p>Finally the tanks appeared coming up the road from
Sommerance. Everybody was elated. At last there was a
chance to get through that wire and mop up those infernal
machine gun nests. But the tanks were under artillery fire,
some of which was evidently doing damage to them, and
with disappointment and disgust the Infantry saw them
pause, turn about and rumble down the road to the rear.
About 10:30 Captain Buck, who had been wounded and
was on his way to the Dressing Station, brought word to
Donovan that a counter-attack was evidently in preparation.
Donovan’s party urged him to let them carry him
back, but he swore at them, and ordered them to bring up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
more machine guns and the Stokes Mortars, under Lieutenant
O’Donohue and Sergeant Fitzsimmons. These were
disposed in an advantageous position, which means a dangerous
one, and the counter-attack was smothered in its
inception.</p>

<p>By 11:00 o’clock Donovan had decided that the 1st Battalion
had too many losses to make it possible for them to
get through. He told Anderson, who was with him, to
return and bring forward his battalion so that Kelly’s men
and their wounded could pass through.</p>

<p>Kelly, whose fighting blood was up, at first refused to retire,
demanding written orders from his chief before he
would give up his claim on the post of danger and glory.
Donovan gave the orders and then permitted himself to
be carried in, leaving the situation in the very capable hands
of Major Anderson.</p>

<p>This relief was begun about noon with the aid of a heavy
barrage from our artillery, of which nobody in the line
knew the exact reason. The reason was that Brigade had
ordered another attack which was originally scheduled for
11:15. Merle-Smith had protested that we had only one
battalion left and that it was unwise to use up our last effectives.
The only result was that the barrage was extended
until noon, on Colonel Mitchell’s report that it
would be impossible to get the orders forward to the front
by 11:15. He sent the order in three different directions,
but none of his messages arrived until the barrage which
was to cover the attack had passed over and the relief of
the 1st battalion had already begun.</p>

<p>The situation was a stalemate. We had made an advance
of three kilometers under desperate conditions, but
in spite of our losses and sacrifices we had failed to take
our final objective. Well, success is not always the reward
of courage. There is no military organization, no matter
how famous, that has not its record of failures. In this
war every regiment and division in the older armies has
known times when it was impossible for them to do all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
that it was hoped they might be able to accomplish, and
most especially when they were called upon to capture well
defended trench positions.</p>

<p>Indeed, since 1915, no commanders in the older armies
would dream of opposing to strongly wired and entrenched
positions the naked breasts of their infantry. They take
care that the wire, or part of it at least, is knocked down
by artillery or laid flat by tanks before they ask unprotected
riflemen to try conclusions with its defenders. When
the wire is deep, and still intact, and strongly defended,
the infantry can do little but hang their heroic bodies on it.</p>

<p>But we shall not dwell on this. The most glorious day
in the history of our regiment in the Civil War was Fredericksburg,
where the Old 69th in the Irish Brigade failed
to capture the impregnable position on Marye’s Heights,
though their dead with the green sprigs in their caps lay
in rows before it. Landres et St. Georges is our Fredericksburg
and the Kriemhilde Stellung our Marye’s Heights.</p>

<p>Whatever the mature judgment of history may decide
about it, the opinion of our Corps Commander, General
Summerall, was the one that counted most. He had been
in command of the 1st Division when it made its attack in
this same area, and was promoted after the battle to the
duty of commanding the corps into which we moved. On
the evening of the 15th he came to our brigade and made
a visit to our P. C. in Exermont to demand why our final
objective had not been taken. He was not well handled,
Colonel Mitchell is a good soldier, and one of the finest
men in the world, but he is entirely too modest to say a
strong word in his own defense. Everybody is familiar
with the kind of man who, in spite of the merits of his
case, makes a poor figure on the witness stand. Donovan,
who is an able lawyer and likes the give and take of battle,
verbal or otherwise, would have sized up the Corps Commander’s
mood and would have been planning a new attack
with him after the first ten minutes. Captain Merle-Smith
stated the facts of the case—the enfilading fire from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
the Cote de Chatillon, the unbroken wire in our front, the
inadequacy of artillery against it on account of lack of air
service to register their fire, the failure of the tanks and
the extent of our losses. General Summerall was in no
mood for argument. He wanted results, no matter how
many men were killed, and he went away more dissatisfied
than he had come.</p>

<p>As a result, by his orders the Division Commander relieved
General Lenihan, Colonel Mitchell and also Captain
Merle-Smith and Lieutenant Betty. As a matter of fact, a
few days later when the ill humor had cooled down, Merle-Smith
was sent back to us in command of a battalion and
Betty also returned. When General Lenihan submitted his
statement of the actions of his brigade (supplemented by
messages and maps) to the Army commander, General
Liggett, the latter assured him that he would name him to
fill the first vacancy in a combat Brigade on the fighting
line. This happened to be in the 77th Division, and two
weeks later I met him at St. Juvin, still in line and going
strong.</p>

<p>I do not wish to adopt too critical a tone with regard to
the action of the Corps Commander. He is the military
superior, and his judgment must be accepted even if it is
wrong. Moreover, the loss of rank or position by officers
weighs nothing with me in comparison with the two big factors:
the proper handling of the men under them; and victory.
In the heat of action every commanding general has
to make rapid decisions. General Summerall came to one of
these decisions in our regard, and we must abide by it.</p>

<p>But speaking as an historian, I think that his decision was
wrong. It was a question of whether our Colonel was a man
to get out of his regiment all that it was capable of. No
person who knows him could ever accuse Harry D. Mitchell
of losing his nerve in a battle. He liked a fight. He would
have been happier out on the line as Lieutenant Colonel
than back in his P. C., but he knew that there was nobody
who could handle an attack and put courage and dash into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
it better than Colonel Donovan, and that any body of
troops, even less experienced and willing than our own,
would fight to the last under such leadership. Colonel
Mitchell’s spirit was equally resolute and his orders crisp
and strong. The whole regiment was devoted to him, and
anxious to do their very best under his command. Indeed,
amongst the older men, there was never any doubt about
our ultimate success. It had taken five days to reduce the
German resistance at the Ourcq, but we did it. With more
help from artillery and tanks, they said, we can make it
yet. The worst blow to our morale that we ever received
was inflicted by the order relieving our Colonel.</p>

<p>The days following were anxious and gloomy ones for
us, and our spirits were kept up by the unchanged dry humor
of the man we were sorry to lose. When he was going,
I said, to relieve the tension: “Now you are leaving
us just when I had you running fine and I’ll have the job
of breaking in another new Commanding Officer.” “Father,”
he said, “this continuous change of Commanders
would break up any other regiment I ever knew, but this
old regiment can keep itself going on, no matter who commands
it. It would get along on spirit and unity if it
never had a Commanding Officer.”</p>

<p>Our new commander was Lieutenant Colonel Charles H.
Dravo, who had been Division Machine Gun Officer. A
number of us have known him for a considerable time
and like him already, all the more because his first action
was a report on conditions in the regiment which was aimed
at the restoration of Colonel Mitchell to his command.</p>

<p>We had 53 officers going in at the Argonne and of those
five were killed and fifteen wounded. Of those killed, after
Captain Michael Walsh, the greatest sense of loss was felt
at the death of Lieutenant Andrew Ellett of Company E, a
soldier of unlimited courage. We did not know until long
afterwards that Lieutenant Henry Davis, an officer of the
same type, who had been wounded by shell fire on October<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
12th, died in Hospital. Two young officers who were comparatively
newcomers in the Regiment, but who had made
many friends, Lieutenants William O’Connor and John P.
Orr, were killed on the field.</p>

<p>Nobody wants to talk very much about the recent battle.
It was a nightmare that one does not care to recall. Individual
acts do not stand out in actions of this kind. It is
a case of everybody going ahead and taking the punishment.
Everybody who stood up under it and kept carrying
on deserves the laurel crown. Some men, however,
stand out in more striking way than their companions,
either through natural coolness and willingness to take
added risks or by their acceptance of a position of command
that the chances of battle offered them. Prominent amongst
these is Sergeant Michael Fitzpatrick of Company L, whose
brother Cornelius was killed at the Ourcq, and who took
charge of a platoon and kept it going with great spirit
after First Sergeant Wittlinger was wounded. The veteran
First Sergeant of Company K, Tim Sullivan, was also
wounded in this fight, and another of the Sullivans, John
L., was killed. Company K also lost a fine character in
Sergeant Gavaghan, a stalwart, heroic, innocent-minded
young Irishman.</p>

<p>When Colonel Donovan called for the Stokes Mortars to
repel the threatened counter-attack on the morning of the
15th, the pieces were set up under the slight protection of
the sloping ground, but from this point the gunners could
not observe the accuracy of their own fire. So Sergeant
Fitzsimmons ran forward to the top of the slope, making
himself an easy cockshot for the German gunners while he
signalled to his own men his corrections on their aim. He
escaped himself by a miracle and had the satisfaction of
seeing the shells dropping right amongst the Germans who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
were gathering for the attack, and doing dreadful execution.</p>

<p>The battalion runners received great praise from everybody,
as they had to take untold risks in moving from
place to place without shelter. Ammunition carriers also
had a dangerous task, those from Company H suffering
severe losses. Amongst those killed were Corporal Clifford
Wiltshire, a nice quiet boy who was married to Sergeant
Winthrop’s sister; and Clinton Bushey, who once before
was reported dead when out on the digging detail during
the bombardment of July 15th. The sergeants we lost were
all good men. Hussey was a clean-cut young athlete; Duff
and Stenson of Company A were both very dependable
men, as were also Sidney Clark, who did great work at the
Ourcq, and Bernard McOwen, who had the Croix de
Guerre. Donnelly and Mahoney of B had worked their
way up from being privates by character and merit; and
Tom Winters was also a good man. Eddie Kearin of C
was one of the best liked youths in the regiment and James
Farnan, a solid Irishman; Dougherty, Colgan, Bechtold
and John Naughton of E have figured before and in these
annals; also Fred Gluck, heroic litter-bearer. Company I
was hard hit in the loss of Patrick Collins and William
Harrison. Charlie Stone’s mother was the last person I
shook hands with before our train left Camp Mills for the
transport. Robert Cousens was killed while looking after
his brother who had been wounded. Sergeant Peter Cooney
of M Company was out with the regiment in ’98 and
the three corporals, Elson, Brennan, and Crunden, were
fine types of soldiers. Harry Dearing, John Claire, John
McKay and the others from the Machine Gun Company
will be sorely missed by their fellows.</p>

<p>With Colonel Donovan on the slope on October 15th
were Sergeants of Headquarters Company and the Machine
Gun Company. The Colonel told me later that the
shell which blew Sergeant Sheahan heavenward took the
legs off another Irish soldier who was with him. This I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>
knew was Patrick Connors. Another Irishman jumped
from a neighboring shell-hole, picked up the wounded man
and kissed him, saying: “Me poor fellow, me poor fellow.”
He put tourniquets on the stumps and then, unaided,
started down the dangerous slope carrying him to the rear.
Gillespie and Doherty tell me that this deed was performed
by Corporal John Patrick Furey of Company H, who was
in charge of the ammunition carriers for the machine guns.
Furey had been wounded already himself, and the sergeants
wanted him to go to the rear, but he refused, as so much
depended on keeping our machine guns fed. When he was
carrying Connors back they shouted to him to get in an
ambulance when he got there; but later in the morning
Furey reappeared alongside them after his two-mile journey
in each direction; and this in spite of the fact that the
strain of carrying his burden had reopened another wound
that he got at the Ourcq. It was an exhibition of tender-heartedness
and sheer courage that honors humanity.</p>

<p>Liaison men have to take untold risks in action of this
kind. Of Major Kelly’s group in the sunken road nearly
all were killed or wounded. Young Eddie Kelly (killed),
Cody (killed), White (a hero in every battle), Liebowitz
(wounded), and Matty Rice (often mentioned in these
annals) worked their way from Kelly to Bootz or from
Kelly to Donovan. When they were gone Corporal Thomas
O’Kelly offered to deliver messages, but the Major wished
to keep him by his side as a valuable man in combat. “Send
me, Major,” insisted Tom, “I’ll carry it through, and if I
don’t come back, you’ll know I’m dead.” He got it through
alright, though wounded. He wanted to go back with a
message, but Colonel Donovan ordered him to go back to
the Dressing-Station. Every last man amongst these men
deserves a citation for bravery.</p>

<p>In this battle one of the tasks which required the greatest
courage was that of getting back the wounded when
the retirement from the wire of the first battalion was ordered.
Their rescuers had to abandon their pits and advance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>
in full view of the enemy in their work of succor.
The men who stood out in accomplishing this dangerous
duty were in Company A: First Sergeant Thomas Sweeney
and Sergeant John H. Dennelly; In Company C, First
Sergeant Thomas P. O’Hagan, Sergeant Joseph Burns and
Corporal Archie Reilly. Also Mike Donaldson, of Company
I, who volunteered for this service and carried in man
after man under heavy fire. Two of the liaison men from
A Company, Matthew J. Kane and Martin Gill, as also John
Hammond and Fred Craven of Company C, are also highly
recommended for the cheerful and efficient manner in which
they performed their perilous job.</p>

<p>Company M is very proud of its youngest corporal, little
Jimmy Winestock, the mildest looking and most unassuming
youth in the regiment. When troops advance under
fire, there are always some who get strayed from their
command, especially when their platoon leaders have been
hit. Jimmy picked up all these stragglers from their companies,
formed them into a detachment, issued his commands
as if he were a major at least, and led them forward
into the thick of action.</p>

<p>Major Lawrence very early in the battle had established
his regimental dressing station as near to the front line as
an ambulance could possibly go. There was absolutely no
protection where he was, and his group which included
Chaplain Holmes and the “Y” Athletic Director, Mr. Jewett,
were exposed to danger from shells at all times. Father
Hanley stuck as usual to his beloved Third Battalion and
was out further living in a hole in the side of a hill, with
Doctors Kilcourse, Martin, Mitchell, Cowett and our dental
officers Bamford and Landrigan, who always rendered good
work in battle.</p>

<p>When they were carrying Donovan in I met him at Lawrence’s
station. He looked up from the stretcher and said
to me smilingly, “Father, you’re a disappointed man. You
expected to have the pleasure of burying me over here.”
“I certainly did, Bill, and you are a lucky dog to get off<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
with nothing more than you’ve got.” He was in great pain
after his five hours lying with that leg in the shell-hole,
but it had not affected his high spirits and good humor.
He was still of opinion that the regiment could get through
the wire, with proper artillery preparation and co-ordination
of infantry forces.</p>

<p>On October 12th I was in Jim Mangan’s little dugout at
Exermont with his Lieutenants Joe McNamara, McCarthy
and Flynn when in walked Dennis O’Shea, formerly our
color sergeant, and now a Lieutenant in the 1st Division.
Accompanying him was Father Terence King, a Jesuit
Chaplain. They had been detailed for the task of burying
their regimental dead. It was a joyous meeting, but they
had one thing to tell that made me sad. Father Colman
O’Flaherty had been killed by shell fire while attending to
the wounded. I had never met him, but when we were
alongside of the 1st after Saint Mihiel I met a large number
of officers and men, all of whom spoke of him with
affectionate admiration. An Irishman, well read, brilliant
and witty in conversation, independent in the expression of
his opinions; sometimes irritating at first encounter by reason
of his sallies, but always sure in the long run to be admired
for his robust and attractive personality.</p>

<p>I got this story with no names mentioned and was too
discreet to ask for them. A patrol was out for the purpose
of getting in touch with the enemy. As they were ascending
the reverse slope of the hill a young officer who was
with two or three men in advance came running back,
stooping low and calling breathlessly to the Lieutenant in
command, “The Germans! The Germans! The Germans
are there.” Nobody thought him afraid but his tone of
excitement was certainly bad for morale. There was a sudden
halt and a bad moment, but the situation was saved
when a New York voice in a gruff whisper was heard,
“Well, what the hell does that guy think we are out here
looking for?—Voilets?” If eloquence is the power to say
things that will produce the desired effect on one’s hearers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
neither Demosthenes nor Dan O’Connell himself ever made
a better speech.</p>

<p>We were very short of officers during the Argonne fight
and, since advancing under shell fire necessitates a deliberate
scattering of men, a great deal depends upon the efficiency
of our non-coms, especially the sergeants. The result
of their activity was that an extraordinary number
of them were wounded. I came on Sergeants Tom O’Malley
and Jim O’Brien of Company D, both wounded severely
and bound for the rear. “Tom,” I said, “what did you
want to get yourself hit for? We’re short of officers as it
is, and it’s only men like you that can put this thing
through.” “Well, Father,” says Tom, smilingly apologetic,
“you see it’s like this: a sergeant stands an awful fine
chance of gettin’ hit as things are goin’ now. We got a
lot of new min that he’s got to take care of to see that they
don’t get kilt; and whin the line moves forward, there’s
some of thim nades a bit of coaxin’.”</p>

<p>I have gathered from my record a list not only of officers,
but also of non-coms wounded in this battle, because they
deserve to be commemorated as men who have fought
throughout the war, men who, if they have not been in
every one of our battles, have a wound stripe to show the
reason for their absence, and who have gained their stripes
of office by good soldiering in camp and in the field.</p>

<h3>ESPERANCE FARM</h3>

<p class="right"><em>October</em> 28th, 1918</p>

<p>Our rear Headquarters are in two buildings on the main
road that parallels the river Aire. In one of them is the
Supply Company and the band. Solicitude for the welfare
of bandsmen is the sole tribute that the army pays to art.
In a neighboring building is an Ambulance Company and
our Company Clerks, who have been ordered to be left in
the rear because records are never properly made out if the
Company Clerk becomes a casualty. I often make use of a
returning ambulance to come back to Captain Kinney’s Hotel
for a decent sleep and a good breakfast. Across the
road in the field a number of the men have made little dugouts
for themselves, as the buildings are overcrowded.</p>

<p>Shell fire does not come back this far except occasionally,
but the nights are often made hideous by enemy bombing
planes. Aeroplanes carrying machine guns are futile
things, but a plane at night dropping bombs is absolutely
the most demoralizing thing in war. It is a matter of psychology.
The man in front discharging his rifle has the
hunter’s exhilaration. Even shells can be dodged if not
too numerous, and after a man has dropped on his face or
jumped into a doorway and has escaped, there is the satisfaction
that a hare must have when it eludes the dogs and
pants contentedly in its hole. But when one lies at night
and hears the deep buzz of a plane overhead, and most especially
when the buzz ceases and he knows that the plane
is gliding and making ready to drop something, the one
feeling that comes is that if that fellow overhead pulls the
lever at the right spot, a very very wrong spot, it means
sudden and absolute destruction. There is no way of getting
away from it. One simply lies and cowers.</p>

<p>Last night we heard the crunching roar six times repeated
in the field just across the road. Flannery and I
got up and pulled on our shoes to go over and see what
happened. Mules had been hit and two of our men slightly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
wounded. The bombs made holes in the soft earth, ten
feet deep and nearly twelve in diameter, and one of them
had fallen at the feet of two of our lads and had not exploded.
I was particularly anxious about a lot of nice
youngsters whom I had picked out after St. Mihiel for the
Band—John Kyle, Robert Emmett Mitchell, Howard
Casey, Pat Campion, Will Maroney, Will King, George
Forms, John Killoran, Denis Glynn, Will Howard,—all
lads that had volunteered before they were eighteen. I
found them unharmed and rather enjoying the show.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Bernard Byrne, who is not long with us and
whose experience in warfare has not been of great duration,
was ordered from the Supply Company a couple of
days ago to duty with Company G. His first night in line
he took out a patrol which he handled admirably and came
back with two prisoners. A very good start indeed.</p>

<p>Everybody has slept in his clothes for weeks. It would
not be true to say that we never take them off, because
that is part of the morning, though not of the evening
ritual. Every morning officers and men, refined or roughneck,
strip to the waist for the process of “Reading his
shirt.” Not to put too fine a touch to it, we are all crawling
with lice. Holmes has a boy who is at the interesting
age of four, and his wife writes to him the usual domestic
stories about his bright ways and sayings. “You ask her
if that kid can read his shirt. Tell her I said that his old
man can do it.” Mrs. Holmes sent word back to Father
Duffy that while the youthful prodigy had not all the accomplishments
of a soldier he could hike with any of us.
I did not get the message for weeks afterwards, as my
brother Chaplain was very much run down and Major
Lawrence and I shipped him off, despite his protests, to the
hospital. I do not need to worry about Father Hanley.
As long as Ambrose Sutcliff’s Goulash Wagon can supply
him with an occasional meal, he will keep going any place
I put him—though that is not the right way to phrase it,
for I always have to keep him pulled back from the places<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>
where he thinks he ought to be. I think I will take both my
Chaplains home with me to the Bronx as curates. A Catholic
church with a Methodist annex would be a novelty.
Back in the peaceful days, a Jew friend of mine whom I
was showing over my combination church and school said
to me, with the quick business sense of his race, “You use
this building for Church on Sunday and for school five
days in the week. The only day it’s idle is Saturday.
What you ought to do is to hire a good smart young Rabbi
and run a synagogue on the Sabbath. I’ll bet you’ll make
money at it.”</p>

<p>The two weeks that elapsed between October 16th and
November 1st were the dreariest, draggiest days we spent
in the war. The men lay out on the bare hillsides in little
pits they had dug for themselves, the bottoms of which
were turned into mud by frequent rains. They had one
blanket apiece, and were without overcoats, underwear or
socks, in the unpleasant climate of a French Autumn.
They were dirty, lousy, thirsty, often hungry; and nearly
every last man was sick.</p>

<p>Captain Bootz, an old-time regular army man and therefore
not sympathetic with imaginary ills, made the following
report on Anderson’s battalion as early as October 17th.
“Checked up strength of battalion shows 405 men for active
combat, including liaison detail. Of this number about
35% are suffering various illnesses, especially rheumatism,
colds and fevers. The Company commanders state that
these men are not receiving medical treatment, which should
be given to them without fail or conditions will be worse
in the next day or so. Some men are doubled up and
should really be in the hospital. I cannot allow these men
to leave, as it would set a precedent for many others to
follow, and this would deplete our fighting strength so
much more. First aid men attached to companies have no
medical supplies other than bandages. A lack of proper
clothing, such as overcoats, heavy underwear and socks,
brings on a great many of these maladies. The majority<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>
of the men have summer underwear, if any, and no overcoat
and only one blanket; and this is entirely inadequate
to keep a soldier in fit physical condition for field service
in the climate that is found this time of year in France. I
deem it my duty that this be brought to the attention of
higher authorities so that they may be rightly informed
as to the actual conditions we are living in, and that means
be found to have the defect remedied immediately.”</p>

<p>As the days went on, conditions got no better. Hundreds
and hundreds of men had to be evacuated as too
weak to be of any military value; and nothing but the need
of man-power kept our doctors from sending half the regiment
to the hospital. The only relief from monotony was an
occasional night patrol, or the prospects which were held out
to us of a fresh order to attack. In spite of the bloody nose
we had already received, our men wished for the order to
try again. Patrols and observation posts reported a lessening
of the enemy’s strength, and our fellows felt certain that
if the tanks would do their share they could get through.
They had met their first repulse. If they had been in the
war as long as the British or French, they would have
learned to take it philosophically as part of the give and take
of the game. But it was their first one, and they were burning
with the desire to get back at the enemy.</p>

<p>On the 21st our brigade relieved the 84th, our 2nd Battalion
taking over the front line on the north edge of the
Cote de Chatillon. The next day orders were out for a new
attack in which the 165th were to work around the eastern
end of Landres et Saint George. Everybody was on the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">qui vive</i> for a new battle but the thing dragged from day
to day until the 26th, when word came that we were to be
taken out of the line and that the Second Division was to
make the attack. Our men were sorely disappointed and
grieved about it, but the decision was a proper one. With
the artillery support that has been gathering in our rear I
have no doubt that our fellows could have broken through,
but we have become too weak in man power to exploit an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>
initial victory in a way that should be done to make the
most of it. Three weeks in line under such conditions do
not fit men for the hardships of a sustained advance. During
this period we lost killed, in Company H, William Murray
and P. Nicholson; and in Company M, Davidson and
Patrick Ames, a soldier who never knew fear.</p>

<p class="right"><em>October</em> 28th, 1918.</p>


<p>I went in to see General Menoher about my concerns as
Division Chaplain. After my business was done he said
that he had received orders to send me back to the States
to make a speaking tour for the Welfare Funds. He kept
talking about these orders long enough to get me worried,
although as I watched his face closely I thought I could
detect a humorous and reassuring twinkle in his pleasant
eyes. Finally, after having been kept on the griddle for
five minutes, I ventured the question, “May I ask, General,
what reply you made to these orders?” Then he laughed
in his genial way. “I told them that you had better work
to do here than there and that I was not going to let you
go.” I certainly do like that man.</p>

<p>Our land battles during these days are being conducted
mainly at night as fights between patrols, the war in the day
time being mainly in the air. On October 16th a German
plane which had been separated from its escadrille
came wabbling over the heads of Major Lawrence’s group
and landed in a field alongside them, the occupants being
made prisoners. Two days later I had the good luck to witness
from the same spot a unique spectacle. There had
been an air fight in which ours got the better of it. A German
plane was evidently in a bad way. As we watched it
we saw a dark object drop from it, and while we held our
breath in sympathetic terror for a human being dropping to
destruction, a parachute opened above him—the first instance
of the kind we have seen in this war. Captain Bootz,
who was under him at the time, said that he managed it
by climbing out on the tail of his plane and dropping off<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>
it from the rear. The great difficulty about using a parachute
for aviators has been that the on-moving plane hits
the ropes before they can drop clear. Most of the air
fights have been the result of the determination of the Germans
to get our balloons. They brought down four of
them one afternoon, much to our disgust.</p>

<p>There is a stock story about the rookie who is persuaded
by his fellows that his tin hat is guaranteed by the government
to turn the direct hit of a German 77. When Colonel
Dravo and the rest of us start to tell how an inch of planking
turned a German 77, we shall be greeted with smiles of
incredulity, but the thing actually happened. Dravo has
a pleasant little Chalet out on the hill 263, beautifully situated
in the forest and affording an excellent place of repose
for weary American officers if the Germans who were
kind enough to build it would only leave their work alone.
But the hill is shelled by day and shelled and bombed by
night, in a picky sort of a way. A small portion of the
shack is boarded off for a kitchen and in it sleep, or rather
slept, for they don’t like the place any more, the force of
our Headquarters mess: Sergeant Denis Donovan, Jimmy
Dayton, Tex Blake, McWalter, and John McLaughlin in
superimposed bunks, so that the lads above were only a
couple of feet below the roof. A shell hit just above them,
the explosion ruining the roof and pitching them all to the
floor; but every particle of iron in it spread itself into the
air outside of the building. Luckily for them it must have
been one of those long-nosed devils that explode on contact
and cause much greater destruction than those that
plow out the ordinary shell hole. The first time I saw the
roads barely scratched where they hit I thought the German
powder was becoming inferior. I know better now.</p>

<h3>HALLOWE’EN</h3>

<p>We are out of the line tonight with the exception of
Reilley’s 3rd Battalion, which is to lie out there in their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>
shelter pits under our barrage and whatever the Germans
may send back in reply until the 2nd Division goes through
them tomorrow. Twelve months ago we had scarcely left
our native shores, a wonderful year in the lives of all of us,
and the last one for many a poor fellow now sleeping in the
soil of France. A lot of the officers are crowded together
in Kinney’s quarters at the Esperance Farm. The room is
hot and close, as shelter-halves and blankets screen every
nook through which light might pass to give information
of human habitation to a passing bomber. Everybody feels
tired, dirty and discouraged.</p>

<p>I said to them, “You are the glummest bunch of Irish
that I ever saw on a Hallowe’en. Johnnie Fechheimer, you
are the best Harp in this bunch; start them singing. Frank
Smith, warm us up with some coffee, since there’s nothing
better to be had.” So Pete Savarese soon had the coffee
boiling and the two Ganymedes, Bob Dillon and Charlie
Lowe, ministered to our needs. Pretty soon they were all
singing—Major Anderson, Kinney, Mangan, Fechheimer,
McDermott, Flynn, McCarthy, O’Donohue, Joe McNamara,
Smith, John Schwinn, even Flannery, Scanlon, and
myself. Joe McNamara, who is as good a youth as they
make them, and who has done great service during the
past three weeks with his signal men, sang a song that was
just on the verge of being naughty, with his handsome blue
eyes twinkling provokingly at me. Dan Flynn knows all
the old songs that our mothers used to sing, “Ben Bolt,”
“You’ll Remember Me,” and all that sort of thing. Fechheimer
and McNamara supplied the modern element in the
concert. But no matter what it was, everybody joined in,
including the men in the loft upstairs and in the shelter
tents outside, especially when it came to songs in praise of
Good Little Old New York; and truck drivers and ambulance
men and passing officers along the road got first-hand
information that the New York Irish 69th had come
through their three long weeks of fighting and hardship
with their tails still erect.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">THE BATTLE OF THE ARGONNE</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span></p>

<p>We had no doubt of the success of the 2nd Division. Artillery
was lined up hub to hub on all the roads around
Exermont, Fleville and Sommerance and the machine guns
of both divisions were to give them a sustained preparatory
barrage. I may add incidentally that the thorough preparations
for their attack were the best justification for our
failure to reach the last objective. We heard the artillery
hammering away through the early morning and it was
soon evident that the sturdy infantry and marines of the
2nd Division had carried the battle line well towards the
north.</p>

<p>I started up with Sergeant Fitzsimmons on my own sad
quest of looking for our dead in the enemy wires. Just
ahead of us as we passed through Sommerance a German
shell lit on the road right in a party of five German prisoners
and four American soldiers. The nine men lay scattered
in all directions. We ran up and I found one of ours with
both legs blown completely off trying to pull himself up
with the aid of a packing case. In spite of his wounds he
gave not the slightest evidence of mental shock. While
Fitzsimmons ran for an ambulance, he told me his name
was Conover, and that he was a Catholic, and said the
prayers while I gave him absolution. He had no idea his
legs were gone until a soldier lifted him on a stretcher,
when I could see in his eyes that he was aware that his body
was lifting light. He started to look but I placed my hand
on his chest and kept him from seeing. Three men were
dead already and it did not seem to me as if any one of
them could live. One of the Germans was an officer who
cursed his fate that brought him to this death by the fire
of his own guns after lasting through four years of war.</p>

<p>When we reached our old battleground I found that one
man had gotten there before me on the same errand as
myself. It was Father Davitt of Lenox, Mass., who had
been detached from the 32nd Division as Corps Chaplain.</p>

<p>On both sides of the Sommerance road as it neared the
wire we saw the bodies scattered, still well preserved and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>
recognizable by reason of the cool weather. Right around
the wire and in the sunken road that ran into it the Germans
had buried them. It was a surprise to find that even
now the wire was absolutely unbroken in any place. An
occasional shell had landed in it, as was evidenced by the
holes made, but the whole fabric was so well bound together
that it simply jumped up and then dropped back into
place again. The 2nd Division had evidently been wise
enough to carry their attack around it as I found just one
of their dead and he was lying in the <em>chicane</em> or passage
made by the highway as it passed through it.</p>

<p>I arranged with Father Davitt to have his detachment of
Pioneers look after the sepulchre of our dead in case the
Regiment got orders to move on, and returned to make
my report to Colonel Dravo.</p>

<p>The 3rd Battalion got back to our place in the rear during
the morning, having suffered some losses from shell
fire, amongst them being Jimmy Fay, who had part of his
foot blown off. Orders to take up the advance were received
on November 2nd, our 3rd Battalion being out of
the line less than 24 hours.</p>

<p>The first day’s route laid down for us showed us that
we were going to take over in the region to the west of
that in which we had been fighting. In the plans for the
attack of the 2nd Division they had moved rapidly towards
the NNE., leaving the Germans on their left to wake up
and find themselves in a salient between our troops and
the northern extension of the Argonne Forest. The 78th
Division was engaged in expediting the evacuation of these
Germans. Two days’ march, neither of them very long,
brought us to Brieulles, just north of which we were to
relieve the 78th. The only difficulty about the march was
for the wagons. Every outfit had lost half of its animals,
and those that were left were in miserable condition. The
artillery felt this hardest, but it made trouble for the infantry,
too, in getting up the supplies and the kitchens.
The worn down roads were frightfully crowded with ambulances,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>
trucks, kitchens, guns, caissons, ration and combat
wagons, headquarters automobiles; and the M. Ps. were
kept swearing till their voices gave out trying to keep traffic
conditions tolerable. When we got to Brieulles we found
that the Germans were blowing up bridges and roads in
their retreat. Colonel Dravo, following tradition and his
own generous instincts of being nice to an old fellow like
me, had sent me on with his car; and Brown was carrying
me rapidly out of Brieulles towards the front when
Major Doyle, our Brigade Adjutant, stopped me and said
that while it didn’t matter much what became of me, cars
were getting scarce and he had decided objections to presenting
what was once a perfectly good car to the Germans.
I deduced from this that the enemy were in the next town
and that I had better stay where I was. The regiment was
stopped at Authé, to which place I returned.</p>

<p>The villages which the Germans had left had a number of
civilians, and in accordance with the order of the German
Commander, the Mayors put a white flag on the church
steeple to warn us against shelling them. I have never seen
a happier lot of old people in my life than the French civilians
whom we were instrumental in saving after four
years of captivity. At Authé our P. C. was in what had
once been a village inn. The proprietress was old and little
and lively and pious. She gave a warm reception to
M. l’Aumonier when she heard that I belonged to the Old
Church, and immediately proceeded to make plans for a
High Mass next Sunday in spite of my telling her that we
would not probably be there more than one night. “I have
been doing most of the preaching to the people around here
the last four years,” she said. “M. le Curé is old and quiet
and he hasn’t much to say; but me, I talk, talk, talk all the
time. I tell these people that God sent the German Devils
amongst them because of their sins. I preach so much that
they have given me a nickname. Do you know what they
call me? They call me Madame Morale. And I preach to
the Germans, too. I tell them they will all be in Hell if they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>
do not mend their ways.” “What do they say to you?”
“Most times they laugh and call me Grossmutter, but some
of them swear and get mad. But I preach at them just the
same. My sister she does not preach, she just prays.”</p>

<p>I went up to see the sister. They must have been both
around eighty; and she sat in her chair looking absolutely
like Whistler’s picture of his mother, except that the hands
were not idle in her lap, but fingered unceasingly a worn
rosary.</p>

<p>Madame Morale’s piety was not limited to preaching. It
included hospitality. We have brought along some fresh
supplies of food for our Headquarters Mess; and as soldiers
from different outfits kept drifting in to the kitchen
looking for water and incidentally anything else they could
get, the old lady dipped into our scanty stock, saying, “Here,
my poor boys, there is much food here”—until nothing was
left.</p>

<p>In going into action in this last phase of the Argonne
fight Lieutenant Colonel Charles Dravo was in command,
with Major Anderson second in command, Captain Merle-Smith
(vice Kelly, evacuated with fever) commanding the
1st Battalion, Captain Henry A. Bootz, in charge of Anderson’s
Battalion, and Major Reilley with the 3rd. We relieved
the 78th Division at the village of Artaise-le-Vivier.
Here the Germans had left in such a hurry that large stores
of flour and vegetables had been left behind. On asking
the inhabitants the reason for this extraordinary occurrence
we were answered by the word “<em>Avions</em>.” In this
sector we have absolute mastery of the air and we see vast
flights of planes spread out like wild ducks in V-shaped
fashion advancing over the German lines. I almost sympathize
with the poor Boches, for I certainly do not like
aerial bombs.</p>

<p>The next three days was a foot-race, each battalion taking
its turn in the lead as the others became exhausted.
They swept from village to village, or rather from hill to
hill, carefully closing around the villages, generally meeting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>
with but little resistance, the last of the Germans, invariably
a machine gun group, taking their flight fifteen minutes
to a half hour before our men could get up. Colonel Dravo
was out in the front with his wild Irish, while Anderson had
the equally important task of trying to get the kitchens and
supplies through. Lieutenants Schwinn, McDermott, Goodell,
Henry and Bell and Sergeant Scanlan labored night and
day to get the kitchens through, crossing muddy fields and
fording small streams because the roads were everywhere
destroyed. Lieutenant Seidelman and Corporal Malone
were busy putting up signs at every corner to guide the rear
elements in the right direction to reach our swiftly moving
advance.</p>

<p>I missed Major Lawrence, who is generally very much
in evidence when action is on, but I discovered that he had
very wisely made up his mind that the main thing was to
see that the ambulances found a way to follow up the Infantry.
He had plenty of willing doctors under him to
look after any wounded men in the field, but it was evident
by the rate our Infantry was traveling that wounded men
would not be evacuated for several days unless the ambulances
got through. When finally they were needed, he
had them there, both for the use of our men and those of
other outfits which had not been so carefully provided for.</p>

<p>For two days the advance was an interesting race. The
6th Division was coming up the road behind ours, anxious
to get a chance to relieve us and get into line before the war
would come to an end. Each night they thought that surely
by morning they would catch up; but our lads, moving
freely across the open country, always kept well in advance
of troops that had to move by column; and each day they
were still further in the van. Our own Mess Sergeants and
Cooks labored night and day to get the food forward, but
for two days and more they, too, were left behind in the
race. The men in front were not left entirely hungry, as
in every village from which they drove the enemy the inhabitants
drew out all of their scanty stores and served<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>
them with coffee, vegetables and a little bread, with unlimited
supplies of bouquets and kisses. In spite of drawbacks
it was a nice war.</p>

<p>At 10:30 on the evening of the 6th, there came a most
extraordinary order from Corps through Division that it
was imperative that Sedan should be captured before the
end of the next day; that if troops were resting they should
be immediately aroused and sent on their way; and that the
city should be taken if the last officer and man should drop
in his tracks. Luckily for the men it took some time to get
that order forward to the line, as the horses of Jack Percy,
Earl Pierce and young Underwood were fatigued by the
incessant work, in which their riders shared, of carrying
messages night and day. So the kitchens got through and
the men were fed before they started out once more.</p>

<p>On November 7th, Bootz with the 2nd Battalion was in
the van. On Hill 332 the Germans put up a stronger resistance
than they had hitherto shown; and it came at a
time when our fire was growing weak on account of the
expenditure of ammunition, which there was little means of
replacing. Bootz told Captain Stout, who was in command
of G Company, that the hill must be taken, and Stout
advanced with thirty-eight men of his own company and a
detachment from Company H to capture the hill. As they
kept crawling in on the Germans the latter began to waver,
and the Captain called on his followers to advance upon
them with fixed bayonets. With a great cheer our fellows
swarmed up the crest and the daunted Germans, after a
futile stand, grounded their guns, threw up their hands and
surrendered. The men whose names stand high in the
Company annals for this deed are, first of all, the dead:
John Danker, George Spiegel, Onefrio Triggiano and Raymond
Hawkins. Also the gallant captain and Lieutenant
Otto; First Sergeant Meagher, Sergeants Martin Murphy,
Martin Shalley, Irving Framan, Denis Corcoran, John
Brogan and Francis Malloy, the two latter being wounded;
James Regan, Thomas Gallagher, Hilbert and Henry, Remington,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>
Youmans and Leavensworth, and, to complete the
list, a bold Choctaw Indian with the martial name of McCoy.
Sergeant Patrick Travers, of Company H, received
high praise from everybody. While the German resistance
was still determined, he went alone against a machine gun
on the right and captured it single-handed, taking three
German officers and four men.</p>

<p>The same day B Company lost Sergeant Ed. Kramer,
and Martin Gilfoyle; C Company, Frank Casserly, Michael
Golinski, and Joseph Peressine; Company E, Orliff Gilbert,
Samuel Kelly and William Lambert; Machine Gun Company,
William Gunnell; and the Sanitary Detachment, Michael
Cavanaugh.</p>

<p>Meanwhile events were happening which made the order
to advance without ceasing seem more extraordinary. Elements
of the 1st Division appeared on our flank and rear.
They, too, had received orders to the same effect from
their Corps Commander, and had advanced to the left
across the front of the 77th Division, and were taking possession
of our line, which was the one leading straight towards
Sedan. They had crept up around Bulson in the
morning, only to find General MacArthur and 84th Brigade
Headquarters in possession of the village. Elements of the
16th Infantry now came on Bootz’s hill and claimed it as
theirs. “This is my hill, and my line of advance,” said
Bootz. “If you say it’s yours, show your booty. I have
twenty-five prisoners and twelve machine guns; what have
you got to show for it?” And Bootz ordered his battalion
to advance, leaving to the others to do what they would.</p>

<p>Nobody blamed the 1st Division for this mix-up, because
they certainly had orders the same as ours to advance and
capture Sedan. The whole thing is a mystery. A staff
officer told me that neither of us had any right here, as
Sedan lies in the sector of the French Division on our left,
and considering what it means to the French, they are
certainly the ones who have the best right to capture it.</p>

<p>In this sector we had a visit from Sergeant Alexander<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>
Woollcott, who is well known in New York as a dramatic
critic, and who has been assigned by G. H. Q. to the
duties of reporter for the <cite>Stars and Stripes</cite>. He is always
on hand when there is trouble, and the field of war becomes
a pleasant place for me whenever he is there. We have
swapped stories and discussed men and books in the weirdest
places. He is communicative rather than inquisitive and
one never thinks of him as a reporter, but he gets all the
information he wants and all the more effectively because
there is no appearance of seeking it. He can even make
Anderson talk.</p>

<p>During this period Anderson had been forging ahead
with his Headquarters group, expecting to find Bootz in
Chaumont. He entered that town with a couple of doctors,
Lieutenant Rerat, and his liaison men, only to find that they
were the first to get there, and the enemy had not yet completely
evacuated it. They were under rifle fire as they
came along the street, and had a merry little sniper’s battle
before they got possession. Then Lieutenant McCarthy set
up his one-pound cannon on the edge of the village, and soon
had the German gunners putting for safety over the hill.
So Anderson captured a town for himself, and for once did
Colonel Dravo out of the bouquets and kisses. Though,
even here, Rerat got the cream of it.</p>

<p>We kept going through that day, the 3rd Battalion relieving
the 2nd during the night, and reaching on November
8th, the village of Wadelincourt on the heights of the
Meuse, directly overlooking Sedan. A patrol from Company
M with orders to go down to the Meuse and scout
up to the suburbs of Sedan, got nearest of all American
troops to that famous city. Eighteen men started out,
of whom most were wounded, but Corporal John McLaughlin,
with two men, carried out the mission and reported the
results of the reconnaissance. Under shell fire that night
Albert Bieber and Carl Maritz of Company I were killed
and Lieutenant Behrendts, the Company Commander, and
many others were wounded. James P. Smith of Company<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>
M was also killed and Sergeant Lester Lenhart of Company
E was mortally wounded.</p>

<p>That night our Division was relieved by the 40th French
Division, which from the beginning had the right of way.
As a matter of courtesy the French Division Commander
invited a company of the 165th and 166th to enter with his
troops for the occupation of the suburbs of Sedan. Company
D of our regiment was selected for the purpose and
Lieutenant Cassidy had them all ready, but through some
mix-up of orders they were not called upon to share in the
little ceremony.</p>

<p>On November 8th we marched back to Artaise and the
next day to Les Petites Armoises; on the 10th, to Vaux-en-Dieulet.
The 11th found us at Sivry-les-Buzancy, where
we spent two days.</p>

<p>On our way in I got a rumor that the Armistice was
signed. I had always believed that the news of victory and
peace would fill me with surging feelings of delight. But it
was just the contrary; no doubt because the constraint I
had put upon my natural feelings during the year were
taken off by the announcement. I knew that in New York
and in every city at home and throughout the world men
were jubilant at the prospects of peace. But I could think
of nothing except the fine lads who had come out with us
to this war and who are not alive to enjoy the triumph.
All day I had a lonely and an aching heart. It would be a
lesser thing to have been killed myself than to go back to
the mothers of the dead who would never more return.
Luckily for me my dear friend Chaplain Nash came over
to see me and walked me for hours through the desolate
country, encouraging me to express my every feeling until
fatigue and the relief of expression brought me back to
a more normal mood.</p>

<p>The men had no certainty that the rumors were true, and
discounted them. On November 13th we marched to Landres
et Saint Georges which we had striven vainly to enter
from the other side five weeks before. The village was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>
almost completely demolished and our troops with others
of the Division pitched their shelter tents on all the hills
surrounding the town. That night official information was
given of the Armistice. The men raided the Engineer and
Signal Stores for rockets of all descriptions and the whole
sky was filled with lights which in war would have demanded
the expenditure of at least a million shells. Bonfires
were blazing all over the hillside <em>Finie la Guerre</em>. The war
was over.</p>

<p>My duties, like my feelings, still lay in the past. With
men from all the companies I went round the battlefield to
pay as far as I could my last duties to the dead, to record
and in a rough way to beautify their lonely graves, for I
knew that soon we would leave this place that their presence
hallows, and never look upon it again.</p>

<p>On the 15th, in accordance with Division orders, a formal
muster was held. Our strength was 55 officers and
1,637 men, with 8 officers and 43 men attached, 1,300
short of the number we had brought into the Argonne. Of
the survivors, not many more than 600 were men who had
left New York with the regiment a little over a year ago.
And most of these belonged to the Adjutant’s Office, Battalion
and Company Headquarters, Kitchens, Band and
Supply Company. In the line companies, there are about
twenty-five rifle men to each company who are old-timers
and nearly all of these have wound stripes earned in earlier
engagements. The great bulk of the old regiment is in hospitals,
convalescent and casual camps; some of them promoted,
some transferred, hundreds of them invalided home,
a great many, alas! buried on battlefields or in hospital
cemeteries.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X<br>
WITH THE ARMY OF OCCUPATION</h2>
</div>

<p>On the 16th we took to the road again, happy at the
thought that the Rainbow Division had received the honor
of being chosen as part of the Army of Occupation. At
the end of the first day’s march our Headquarters were at
Baalon. Crossing the Meuse at Duns sur Meuse I ran into
Hogstrom and Mullen of Company C, whom I had thought
dead, but who had been captured by the Germans in the
wire on the night of October 14th. They had been well
used, they said, except for the fact that there was little to
eat. We crossed the Belgian frontier on the morning of
November 21st at the village of Fagny, which was all decorated
up like Old Home Day. The village band—a nondescript
outfit—played us into town. The people had made
out of dress material American flags, or rather well-meant
attempts at them, as five or six stripes and a dozen stars
was about as near as they could come to it. After crossing
the border we received a new commanding officer in the
person of Colonel Charles R. Howland, a regular army
man who had a regiment in the 86th Division. When that
Division was broken up for replacement purposes, he was
assigned to fill the vacancy in ours. About the same time
Colonel Henry J. Reilly, who had been ably handling our
brigade during the past five weeks, was superseded by
General F. M. Caldwell, U. S. A. Colonel Reilly returned
to the command of the 149th F. A.</p>

<p>As we crossed Belgium at its southmost tip, we made
only a two days’ job of it, headquarters being at Ste. Marie
on November 21st and at Thiaumont November 22nd. My<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span>
chief impressions were of a clean, orderly, prosperous country
as compared with the ruined parts of France, and a
very intelligent curé in whose house I stopped at Ste. Marie.
When we passed the borders of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg
at Oberpollen on the 22nd there were no brass
bands to greet us. The inhabitants were civil and pleasant
but they adopted a correct attitude towards us as foreigners
crossing through their territory. Most of the regiment was
billetted, and rather well accommodated, at Useldingen, a
comfortable town with a fine new parish church. Here we
stayed until the 1st of December, till arrangements could
be made for our passage into Germany. We are part of the
Third Army now, and the Third Army has been organized
on a shoe-string. It cannot be said to be functioning very
well, and the system of supplies and equipment is not in
good shape. We have gotten a good deal of equipment—and
we never needed it worse than after leaving the Argonne—but
there are many old and ill-fitting shoes, which
makes hiking a torture for the men.</p>

<p>The principal sight of Useldingen is the ruins of a very
extensive medieval castle, standing on an elevation in the
middle of the town. I wandered through it with Vandy
Ward and Read of H. Q. Co., trying with the aid of the
Curé to get an idea of its original plan and the sort of
life that was led there by other soldiers a thousand years
ago.</p>

<p>Thanksgiving Day came round while we were here and
everybody worked to celebrate it in proper fashion. There
is a fair supply of food in the country, though one has to
pay high prices for it, all the higher because the national
currency is in marks and the people demand the old rate of
100 francs for 80 marks. But, like all Americans, we want
what we want when we want it, so the canny Luxembourgeois
get what they ask for. Our religious services were in
thanksgiving for peace. In the church we had a solemn
high mass and Te Deum and I preached, Father Hanley
singing the Mass. As Chaplain Holmes had not yet returned,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>
I unfrocked myself of my papistical robes and
went out to hold general services in the romantic courtyard
of the old Schloss, using a breach in the fortifications
as a pulpit. My friend Chaplain Halliday of the Ohios
came along and added a few words in his earnest, sensible
style.</p>

<p>There is great joy in the regiment, for Captain Hurley
is back. He looks thin and none too fit, and I know he
is with us, not because the hospital authorities thought that
he should be, but through his own strong desire and pleading
eloquence. We had a visit from Donovan also—on
crutches. The Provost Marshal General had him transferred
to his department while he was in the hospital, and
now he is touring the country in a car, performing his new
services. It is not a bad sort of a job at all—with headquarters
in Paris, and a chance to tour all over France in a
first-class automobile, with the best billets and the best food
wherever he goes—but not for Donovan. No one of our
enlisted men marooned in a casual camp with a lot of absolute
strangers ever uttered with greater longing and pathos
the formula, “I want to be back with my old outfit.” For
Donovan’s case I shall omit the pathos. When that young
man wants anything very bad he gets it. I expect to see
him back on duty with us in a very, very brief time.</p>

<p>My mail is a very full one these days. All of our old-timers
back in hospitals and camps are clamoring to return
to the regiment, and they think that if I only speak to
somebody, a word from me will manage it. I went to
Mersch to see my ever kind friend, Colonel Hughes, our
Divisional Chief of Staff, to inquire if some general arrangement
could not be made for the return of all men in
combat divisions who had been evacuated from the line
through wounds or sickness. I found that he was doing
everything that he possibly could to get our Rainbow fellows
back, and he promised to work for an order along
the lines I proposed.</p>

<p>The regiment marched on the 1st of December, Headquarters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>
passing the night at Mersch; and on December
2nd to Waldbillig. December 3rd was the day on which we
finally accomplished what we had started out to do—make
our invasion of Germany. We crossed the border by a
bridge over the Sauer river into the village of Bollendorf.
Captain John Mangan, who had come to the regiment on
business from the 2nd Army, George Boothby of the New
York <cite>World</cite> and myself crossed the bridge ahead of the
others, very curious to see what reception we would get in
the land of the enemy. The first indication of the sort of
reception we were to have came from an invitation from
an old farmer and his wife whose house stood at the end of
the bridge to step inside and have a glass of schnapps;
when we prudently declined this, we were offered apples,
but not being there as visitors, we felt it proper to say no.
The proffered kindnesses were inspired partly no doubt by
a desire to propitiate, but nobody could doubt that it was
largely the decent impulse of a nice old couple. We rejoined
the regiment for the march across.</p>

<p>The column came down along the river, the band in front
playing “The Yanks Are Coming” and, as we turned to
cross the bridge, the lively regimental tune of “Garry
Owen.” In front of us, above the German hill, there was
a beautiful rainbow. As we marched triumphantly onto
German soil, nothing more hostile greeted us than the click
of a moving-picture camera. Every soldier in the line was
glowing with happiness except myself, perhaps. On occasions
like this of glory and excitement my mind has a habit
of going back to the lads that are gone.</p>

<p>We marched, with advance and rear guards, as if entering
a hostile country, our first stop being at Holsthum. We
had hopes that our line of march would take us down the
Moselle Valley towards Coblenz, but instead we struck off
to the north and northeast, through the rough Eiffel country,
along mountain roads that were badly worn down by
the traffic of war. Our Headquarters for December 5th,
6th, 7th, 8th and 9th were Blickendorf, Wallerschein, Hillesheim<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span>
(a romantic spot), Weisbaum and, after a desperate
hike, Wershofen.</p>

<p>The greatest surprise of our first week in Germany was
the attitude of the people towards us. We had expected to
be in for an unpleasant experience, and I have no doubt that
some of our fellows had a picture of themselves moving
around in German villages with loaded rifle and fixed bayonet
ready to repel treacherous attacks. We were received
very peacefully, one might almost say, cordially. Farmers
in the fields would go out of the way to put us on the
right road, children in the villages were as friendly and
curious as youngsters at home; the women lent their utensils
and often helped soldiers with their cooking, even offering
stuff from their small stores when the hungry men
arrived far ahead of their kitchens. There were many German
soldiers in these towns still wearing the uniform (they
would be naked otherwise), and they, too, were interested,
curious, almost friendly. Some of them had been against
us in battle, and with the spirit of veterans in all times and
places, they struck up conversation with our men, fighting
the battles over again and swapping lies. I talked with the
priests in the different towns—one of them a Chaplain just
returned from the Eastern front. Like all the others that
we meet, they say that their country had the French and
British licked if we had stayed out; to which I make the
very obvious retort that they had followed a very foolish
policy when they dragged us in.</p>

<p>But it is only occasionally that this note is struck, the
attitude of most people being that the war is over and
they are glad of it. In fact, a surprising number have
wanted to have it over for a considerable time past. No
doubt the historical background of life in these countries
makes them able to take defeat with more philosophy than
we could ever muster up if foreign troops were to occupy
our country. As for us, we are here in the rôle of victors,
and our soldiers are willing to go half way and accept the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span>
attitude that for them also (unless somebody wants to start
something) the war is a past issue.</p>

<p>Civilians hold grudges, but soldiers do not; at least the
soldiers who do the actual fighting. The civilian mind is
fed up on all sorts of stories about atrocities, most of which
I believe are fabricated to arouse decent human beings up
to the point of approving of this rotten business of war.
We fought the Germans two long tricks in the trenches and
in five pitched battles and they never did anything to us that
we did not try to do to them. And we played the game
as fairly as it can be played. We followed their retreat
through three sectors, in two of which they had been for
years, and we never witnessed at first hand any of the
atrocities we read about. A church burned at St. Benoit
without any good military reason that I could see; the shelling
of the hospital in Villers sur Fere, in which case there
was no way for them to know it was a hospital; some valuables
piled up for carrying away—that is the whole indictment.
But no crucified soldiers, no babies with their hands
cut off, no girls outraged in trenches, to provoke our soldiers
to rush on to death to rescue them, no poisoned food
or wells (except of course through gas shells), no women
chained to machine guns, and no prisoners playing treachery.</p>

<p>In the invaded territory of France we found plenty of
evidence of harsh military occupation. It was bad at its
best, and some local commanders made it more intolerable.
The people were taxed without much to show for their
money, forced to work for little or no pay, rationed rather
slenderly though with enough to sustain strength, had to
put up with requisitions of animals, houses and some minor
property, such as linen and copper down to bedsheets and
the brass knobs off the stoves. They were also dragooned
about to various places to do work for their conquerors.
I heard plenty of tales in Eastern France and Belgium of
terrible experiences and unwarranted executions during the
first couple of weeks of the German occupation from witnesses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span>
whose word I believe absolutely. After the civilians
were thoroughly cowed these atrocities ceased, though
many of the lesser hardships of military occupation persevered
during the four years.</p>

<p>Most of the French and Belgians told me (though some
voiced suspicions to the contrary) that the Germans saw
to it strictly that none of their soldiers took the relief goods
sent from America. One old lady told me that she had proof
that all Germans were robbers; for they give her some
patched clothing as coming from America and she knew
that nobody in America would send over such stuff as that.
It was hard to have to choose between being just and being
loyal American. I refuse to state which attitude I took,
but I am afraid that the dear old lady still thinks she
has an argument to prove that the Boches are robbers.</p>

<p>At any rate, the older griefs of these people are for the
soldiers who have come through an intense war experience,
echoes of “Old unhappy far-off things, and battles long
ago.” They judge the German soldier by their own experience
and by soldier standards. They do not fear him,
they do not hate him, they do not despise him either. They
respected him when he put up a good fight or made a clean
getaway, and that was most of the time. It was a rare
thing to hear a soldier in a combat division talk about
“Huns.” It was always the “Heinies,” the “Jerries,” the
“Boches” or, simply the “Germans.”</p>

<p>The fine spirit on the part of our troops was much better,
even for military value, than hatred would have been. I
cannot see that deep bitterness could have made them any
bolder. It would only have made them less efficient. And
the spirit is admirable in itself.</p>

<p>At any rate we were convinced from the beginning that
our experiences as part of the army of occupation were
not going to be as unpleasant as we expected.</p>

<p>Aside from the attitude of the people the things that
strike us most are two. Putting the two into one, it is
the number and the fatness of the children. There are few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span>
children on the streets in French villages; German villages
swarm with youngsters. Our coming is like circus day and
they are all out, especially the boys. Boys everywhere! And
such sturdy little towheads—chubby is the word for the
smaller ones. I do not know about the rest of Germany,
but the Rhineland is certainly not starved. Perhaps, as in
Belgium, it is the townspeople who do the suffering. These
children wear patched clothing, but the clothing covers
rounded bodies. We find it easy to purchase meals at rates
that are astoundingly reasonable after our experience in
other European countries. Germany lacks many things—edible
bread, good beer, real coffee, kerosene, rubber, oil,
soap and fats; and in the cities, no doubt, meat and milk.
The people here say that they eat little meat, their sustenance
being largely vegetable and based on the foundation of
the potato. It scores another triumph for the potato.</p>

<p>But I would like to know how they fatten the children.
With good advertising a man could make a fortune on it
at home. German breakfast food for boys, with pictures
of chubby young rascals playing around American soldiers.
But perhaps Germans are plump by nature or divine decree,
and it would not work with lantern-jawed Yanks like ourselves.</p>

<p>During this period Lieutenant Colonel Donovan returned
to duty with us by direct orders of General Headquarters,
Lieutenant Dravo going back to his duties as Division Machine
Gun Officer, thus being still near enough to us to keep
up the ties of friendship which he had established in the
Regiment. We remained in Wershofen and surrounding
villages for five days, during which time the equipment
was gone over, animals rested and some attempt made to
patch up the shoes of the men, which had been worn to
nothing by hiking with heavy packs on rough roads. On
December 14th, we marched through the picturesque valley
of the Ahr river over a good road to Altenahr, the scenery
of which looks as if it had been arranged by some artistic
stage manager with an eye to picturesque effect. It is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span>
summer resort country and we had the advantage of good
hotels for billets. On December 15th, we marched through
Ahrweiler, an old walled town which was to be our Division
Headquarters, and Neuenahr, a modern summer resort
place with good roads, commodious hotels and attractive
shop windows, and thence to the Rhine, where, turning
north about two kilometers, we entered the most pleasant
and excellent town of Remagen-am-Rhein, which was
to be our home for the next three or four months.</p>

<p>Remagen was already in existence in Roman days. It is
a charming well-built place of 3,500 inhabitants, with a
large parish church and also an Evangelical church and a
synagogue. In addition, there is on the hillside a striking
pilgrimage church attended by Franciscan Friars and dedicated
to St. Apollinaris, with the Stations of the Cross
built on the roadway leading up to it. The much advertised
bottled waters which flow from a source near Neuenahr
get their name from this shrine. Remagen has also
a large convent, Annacloster, a hospital and a town hall,
in front of which our daily guard mounts are held.</p>

<p>I am afraid, however, that these edifices for religious and
municipal uses made less immediate appeal to our fellows
than the fact that the town possessed a number of large and
commodious hotels, some of them ample for a whole company.
We immediately took possession of these as well as
of stores, beer-gardens and extra rooms in private houses;
the principle being that every soldier of ours should have
a bed to sleep in, even if the German adult males had to go
without. Donovan and I went on ahead to billet for Headquarters.
We called on the Bürgermeister, a kindly, gentlemanly,
educated man, who was anxious to do everything to
make our stay in town a harmonious one. His assistant, an
agreeable young man who had been in America for a couple
of years and had every intention of going back, came along
with us on our tour. We had our pick of two or three
modern villas of grandiose type north of the town on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span>
hillside, the only difficulty about them being that they were
a little too far away.</p>

<p>At first two of our battalions were placed in mountain
villages to the west, but after a week or so we had everybody
accommodated in Remagen. I settled down with my
gallant followers, Halligan and McLaughlin, in the house
of the Bürgermeister, which faced on the river just north of
the parish Church. My German is a very sad affair, but
he speaks French and his wife English. They have three
nice children, the oldest about twelve. I keep my relations
with the parents as official as is possible, when one is dealing
with gentlefolks, but if I am expected to avoid fraternizing
with the youngsters, they will have to lock me up or shoot
me. I had a conference with the Parish Priest, a sturdy
personality who has his flock in good control, at my house
the other day and we were talking four languages at once—German,
French, English and Latin. But I worked out
my plans for a Christmas celebration.</p>

<p>Christmas Mass on the Rhine! In 1916, our midnight
mass was under the open sky along the Rio Grande; in
1917, in the old medieval church at Grand in the Vosges;
and now, thank Heaven, in this year of grace, 1918, we
celebrated it peacefully and triumphantly in the country
with which we had been at war. Attendance was of course
voluntary, but I think the whole regiment marched to the
service with the band preceding them playing “Onward
Christian Soldiers” and “Adeste Fideles.” We took full
possession of the Church, though many of the townsfolk
came in, and when at the end, our men sang the hymn of
Thanksgiving, “Holy God, we praise Thy name” the Germans
swelled our chorus in their own language “Grosser
Gott wir loben Dich.” I preached on the theme “Can the
war be ascribed to a failure on the part of Christianity?”
I have been often irritated by ideas on this subject coming
from leaders of thought who have given little place or opportunity
to Christianity in their lives or projects. As
Chesterton says: “Christianity has not been tried out and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span>
found wanting; Christianity has been tried—a little—and
found difficult.” Father Hanley sang the Mass, the Guard
of Honor with the Colors being from Company K, with
Captain Hurley in charge.</p>

<p>For the Company dinners I was able to supply ample
funds through the never-ceasing generosity of our Board
of Trustees in New York City, and funds also placed at my
disposal which were sent by Mrs. Barend Van Gerbig
through the Veteran Corps of the 69th New York. But
in their purchase of food, the wily mess sergeants found that
soap was a better medium of exchange than money.</p>

<p>During January and February the men were kept busy
during the day in field training, infantry drill, range practice
and athletics. Particular attention was paid to smartness
of appearance and punctiliousness in soldierly bearing
and courtesy. The weather was mild though often rainy.
Coal was not too hard to procure and the billets were kept
fairly comfortable. The regiment being all in one town
there was a fine soldier atmosphere in the place. The
townspeople are a kindly decent sort, but our fellows have
enough society in themselves and there is little fraternization,
and none that is a source of any danger—there is
more chance of our making them American in ideas than
of their making us German.</p>

<p>The Welfare Societies are on the job with good accommodations.
In the “Y” we have still Jewett and the ever
faithful Pritchard and two or three devoted ladies, one of
whom is Miss Dearing, a sister of Harry Dearing who was
killed in the Argonne. Jim O’Hara of the K. of C. got
the Parish Priest to give up his Jugendheim, a new building
with large hall, bowling alleys, all the German Verein sort
of thing. There is no lack of places to go or ways to spend
an evening. Lieutenant Fechheimer took charge of athletics
and we had brigade contests, and also with the Canadians,
who were just to the left of the Ohios.</p>

<p>The 3rd Battalion has lost the service of Mr. Kelly of
the “Y.” When I first knew Mr. Kelly of the “Y” he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span>
Corporal Kelly of Company I, 69th Regiment, at McAllen,
Texas, and was sometimes known, Irish fashion, as “Kelly
the Lepper,” as he was a famous runner. His eyes were
not as good as his legs, so he was turned down for reenlistment.
Being determined to have a part in the war he
got the “Y” to send him over as an athletic instructor and
finally worked his way up to our regiment and was attached
to the 3rd Battalion which includes his own company.
The assignment was more to the advantage of the
3rd Battalion than of the Y. M. C. A. for Kelly gave away
gratis everything he could wheedle, bully, or steal from the
“Y” depot officials. When we reached the Rhine, things
were too quiet for Kelly and he started off to visit his native
town in Ireland. If I ever hear that somebody has gotten
stores from the police barracks to equip the Sein Feiners,
I shall know that Kelly the Lepper is on the job.</p>

<p>My own life is an altogether pleasant one. I have for
my office a well furnished parlor on the ground floor of the
Bürgermeister’s house where I spend my mornings with Bill
Halligan, mainly at the task of writing letters to soldiers
who want to get back and to folks at home who ask news
of their dear ones, living or dead. In the afternoons I float
lazily around amongst the companies, just chatting and
gossiping, and getting in a good deal of my work in my
own way, sort of incidentally and on the side; or I drop in
at headquarters and bother Captain Dick Allen and Jansen
and Ed Farrell of the Personnel Department for correct
data for my diary, or Ted Ranscht and Clarke for maps.
Or I look in on the juvenile pro-consuls Springer and Allen
to smile at the air of easy mastery with which they boss the
German civilians into observing American Military Commands.
My nights I spend at the building of the “Y” or
K. of C. amongst the men, or at home, receiving numerous
guests with a world of topics to discuss. It is an agreeable
kind of existence, with no urgent duties except correspondence,
and with the satisfaction of performing a not unimportant
service without any feeling of labor, but merely by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span>
kindly and friendly intercourse. My orderly, “Little Mac,”
is having the time of his life. If I only had a car for him
to drive me around in, as Tom Gowdy did in Texas, he
would never want to go home to the Bronx.</p>

<p>Father Hanley was made director of amusements and
was kept busy providing entertainment five nights a week
from our own and other Divisions for the two large halls
conducted by the Y. M. C. A. and the K. of C., a task which
he accomplished as he does everything—to complete satisfaction.</p>

<p>One thing that astonished everybody in this New York
regiment was the number of illiterates amongst replacements
from the Southern States. We had two hundred
men who could not sign their names to the pay-roll. A
strong movement was started throughout the American
Expeditionary Forces after the Armistice to teach such men
to read and write, and the simplest problems in arithmetic,
as well as to give a better knowledge of English to foreign
born soldiers. In our regiment this task was confided to
Chaplain Holmes, who went at it with his usual devotion to
duty and attention to details, so that Chaplain Nash who
was Divisional School Officer told me that the educational
work in the 165th was by far the best in the Division.</p>

<p>I had many examples of the need of schooling for certain
of the men. Many of our recent replacements had been
kept going from place to place and had not received pay
in months. Whenever I heard of such cases I advanced
them money from our Trustee’s Fund. One evening three
of our old-timers came to my billet to borrow some money
to have a little party, but I had to tell them that my stock
of francs was cleaned out. Just then a fine big simple fellow
from the Tennessee mountains came in to return the
money I had loaned him. “How much do you owe me?”
I asked. “Thirty-seven francs.” “All right, hand it over to
these fellows here.” “Well, I reckon I’d rather pay you.”
After a certain amount of joking about it, it dawned upon
my slow intelligence that the poor fellow was embarrassed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span>
by not being able to count money, so I took him into
another room and tried to teach him how much change he
should have out of a fifty franc note.</p>

<p>The efforts of our generous friends in New York in
supplying funds were much appreciated by the whole regiment.
We had been in line for months and the men were
seldom paid. Even when payday came those who were
absent in hospital, or those who had been absent when the
pay-roll was signed, got nothing. The funds were left
absolutely at my disposal, and I knew from the calibre of
our Trustees that it was their wish that they should be disbursed
in a generous spirit. Many of our bright sergeants
were started off to Officer’s School without a sou in their
pockets. I believed that our New York backers would like
to have the best men of our regiment able to hold up their
heads in any crowd, so I saw that every one of them had
fifty or a hundred francs in his pocket before starting.
When I could be sure of addresses, I sent money to men
in hospitals and in casual camps. While the regiment was
in line money was no use to anybody, as there was absolutely
nothing to buy, not even an egg or a glass of wine,
but here in Germany, with shops and eating houses open,
my cash was a real boon, and I did not hesitate to disburse
it.</p>

<p>Just after the armistice, with the prospect that leaves
might at last be granted, I sent to our trustees a bold request
for $20,000.00, to guarantee the men a real holiday.
When the permissions for leaves came I found that in most
cases this money was not needed, as the long deferred pay
gave most of the men sufficient money of their own. So I
devoted a generous amount of it to help finance the company
dinners which were gotten up on a metropolitan scale
in the hotels of Remagen. These were joyous affairs—feasts
of song and story-telling and speech-making. Colonel
Donovan and I made it a practice to attend them all,
and he got in many a strong word on spirit and discipline
which had better results in that environment than could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span>
have been produced on a more formal occasion. Father
Hanley was always a favorite at these gatherings as he
handed out the latest rumors (which he himself had manufactured),
discoursed on the superiority of Cleveland over
New York, and of the 3rd Battalion over any other bunch
of fighting men in the whole universe. It was a part of my
share in the function to speak on the good men in the Company
that had paid the great price; and it is a tribute to the
loyalty and steadfastness of human nature to see how the
merry-makers would pause in their enjoyment to pay the
tribute of a sigh or a tear to the memory of their companions
of the battlefield who were absent from their
triumph.</p>

<p>Our winter on the Rhine was our happiest period in the
whole war. First and foremost the regiment was all together
in one place; and companionship is by far the biggest element
of satisfaction in a soldier’s life. The men had good
warm billets and most of them had beds to sleep on. The
food was substantial and plentiful, though, for that matter,
I think we were at all times the best fed army that ever
went to war. There were periods of starvation in battles,
but the main difficulty was even then in getting it from the
kitchen to the men in line.</p>

<p>The men had enough work to do to keep them in good
healthy condition and to prevent them from becoming discontented;
but all in all, it was an easy life. All of the
old-timers got a chance to go off on leave, most of them
choosing Paris, the Riviera, or Ireland. Short excursions
to Coblenz by rail or river were given to everybody.</p>

<p>Our band had a prominent part in adding to the pleasures
of life. Bandmaster Ed. Zitzman had returned from school,
and he with the Drum Major John Mullin and Sergeants
Jim Lynch and Paddy Stokes made frequent demands on
me for funds to purchase music and extra instruments. In
France I had bought sixteen <em>clairons</em> or trumpets for the
Company buglers to play with the Band. Here on the
Rhine I bought other instruments, including orchestral<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span>
ones, so we were well supplied for field or chamber music.
Lieutenant Slayter took charge of the Band in matters of
discipline and march time, with excellent results.</p>

<p>One of the greatest of our successes during this period
was the 165th Minstrels, organized by Major Lawrence,
always active in everything for the good of the men. After
having scored a distinct hit at home and throughout the
Division, they went on a tour through the Army of Occupation,
and were booked to go back through France if we
had remained longer abroad. The performers were: <em>Interlocutor</em>,
William K. McGrath; <em>End Men</em>, Harry Mallen,
Thomas McCardle, Harold Carmody, Edward Finley, and
Charles Woods; <em>Soubrettes</em>, Robert Harrison, James
O’Keefe, James F. O’Brien, William O’Neill, James Mack,
Melvin King, and John McLaughlin; <em>Chorus</em>: Charles
Weinz, Edward Smith, John Brawley, John Ryan, John
Zimmerman, John Mullins, Thomas O’Kelly, Eugene Eagan,
Walter Hennessey, Peter Rogers, William Yanss, Clinton
Rice, Thomas Donohue, Chester Taylor, Sylvester Taylor,
James Kelly, Charles Larson, with T. Higginbotham
as strong man and Milton Steckels as contortionist.</p>

<p>The health of the command has been excellent, although
since we have come into civilized parts we have developed
a certain amount of pneumonia which we escaped while
living in the hardships of the Argonne. Since leaving Baccarat
I know of only two of our men who have died from
other than battle causes; Private Myers of the Machine Gun
Company was drowned in the Marne in August and John
E. Weaver of Company L died during the same month of
illness. In Germany we lost Corporal Patrick McCarthy,
Company E, died of pneumonia October 20th, W. J. Silvey
of Company D, James Kalonishiskie and Robert Clato
of M, James C. Vails of H, Corporal Joseph M. Seagriff,
James O’Halloran, Charles Nebel and Terrence McNally of
Supply Company, Emery Thrash and George Sanford of L,
Carl Demarco of F, and one of the best of our Sergeants,
John B. Kerrigan of Headquarters Company.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span></p>

<p>Our only grievances were the difficulties of getting back
our old officers and men, and the stoppage of promotions
for officers after the Armistice. Every day my mail had a
number of letters from soldiers all over France asking me
to get them back to the Regiment; and work on this line
constituted my greatest occupation. Many of the men took
the matter in their own hands and worked their way across
France, dodging M. P.’s, stealing rides on trucks and trains,
begging meals from kindly cooks and nice old French
ladies, and finally, if their luck held out, getting back
amongst their own. Others were returned by a more legitimate
route, until, by the time we left the Rhine we had nearly
fourteen hundred men who belonged to the original command.</p>

<p>A large number of our officers had been recommended,
some of them over and over again, for promotion, and had
not received it on account of wounds which kept them in
hospitals when the promotion might have come through.
And now they were barred from receiving the rank which
they had earned on the battlefield, the vacancies being filled
by replacements. Some of these replacement officers made
themselves a warm place in the heart of the regiment especially
Major James Watson, who joined us in Luxembourg
and was put in command of the 3rd Battalion; and also an
old friend of ours from the 12th New York, Major Jay
Zorn, who was with us for a short time.</p>

<p>Finally this legitimate grievance was settled in the most
ample and satisfactory fashion. Lieutenant Colonel Donovan
was made Colonel, and placed in command of the
regiment, Colonel Howland going to take charge of a leave
area in France. Major Anderson was made Lieutenant
Colonel, and Bootz, Meaney and Merle-Smith Majors.
There were also a number of promotions to the rank of
Captain both in the line companies and in the Sanitary
Detachment. There were two other men that we all felt
should have gotten their majority, but when the original
recommendations were made they were both suffering from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</span>
wounds in hospitals with no seeming prospects of ever getting
back to the regiment. These two were Captain John P.
Hurley and Captain Richard J. Ryan, who also, to everybody’s
great delight, rejoined us on this river (which we
call the Ryan river) though still in a doubtful state of
health.</p>

<p>Many of these promotions came after Donovan’s accession
to the command and through his energetic efforts. He
also made use of every possible means through official and
private channels, to get back every officer and man of the
Old Regiment that was able to come. First and foremost
amongst these was Lieutenant Colonel Timothy J. Moynahan,
who left us in Baccarat as a Major and had won
his Lieutenant Colonelcy as well as a D. S. C. and a Croix
de Guerre with the 37th Division. Jack Mangan, now
Major Mangan, came back from 2nd Army Headquarters.
We had an abundance of majors though we had lost one
of them—Major Tom Reilley, who had been sent home
much against his will for a promotion which he never received,
just after the fighting was over.</p>

<p>We also got back a lot of happy lieutenants who had
gone to officers Candidate Schools, and had been commissioned
in other Divisions, the happiest of the lot, I think,
being Leo Larney, a fine athlete and a fine man. We had
often recommended men for promotion in the regiment
but had been successful in very few cases. Sergeant
Thomas McCarthy was commissioned after the Ourcq;
and later on Sergeants Patrick Neary and John J.
Larkin were sent back to us from school as sergeants
because the war started too soon after they left Ireland.
When facilities for becoming citizens were extended to men
in their case, they received their commissions in the regiment,
and both did remarkable work in the Argonne. Sergeant
Frank Johnston of Company E was for a long time
an officer without knowing it, as his commission had been
sent to his home address.</p>

<p>Colonel Donovan also inaugurated a series of little entertainments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span>
and dinners, inviting the leading officers of
other regiments in the Division to partake of our Metropolitan
Hibernian hospitality. Everybody in the Division likes
Donovan, and they were as much delighted as we when he
finally got command of the Regiment that he had so often
led in action. One of our greatest friends is Colonel John
Johnson of the Engineers, a manly forthright two-fisted
South Carolinian; we delight also in verbal encounter with
Colonel Henry Reilly of the 149 Field Artillery, a man of
wide experience, unlimited mental resources, and agile wit.
The other three infantry colonels Hough, Screws and Tinley
have been with the Division from the beginning and our
interchange of visits with them will be always one of the
pleasantest recollections of the campaign.</p>

<p>We celebrated St. Patrick’s Day on the Rhine in the best
approved manner with religion, games and feasting. My
altar was set up in a field beside the river. The theme for
my discourse was the debt that the world owes to the sons of
Saint Patrick for their fight for civil and religious liberty
at home and abroad, with the prayer that that debt might
now be squared by the bestowal of liberty on the Island
from whence we sprung.</p>

<p>The day before Saint Patrick’s Day the whole Division
was reviewed by the Commander-in-Chief, General Pershing,
at Remagen. It was a note-worthy military ceremony
in an appropriate setting, by the banks of that river
of historic associations. When he came to our regiment
the eyes of General Pershing were taken by the silver furls
which covered the staff of our flag from the silk of the
colors to the lowest tip. In fact, that staff is now in excess
of the regulation length, as we had to add an extra foot to
it to get on the nine furls that record our battles in this
war. “What Regiment is this?” he asked. “The 165th
Infantry, Sir.” “What Regiment was it?” “The 69th New
York, Sir.” “The 69th New York. I understand now.”</p>

<p>This visit was the final hint that our stay was not to be
long. The whole Division got together to organize the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</span>
Rainbow Division Veterans which we did at an enthusiastic
and encouragingly contentious meeting at Neuenahr.</p>

<p>When the orders finally came for our return to America
I received them with a joy that was tinged with regret that
the associations of the past two years were to be broken
up. They had been years full of life and activity, and
take them all in all, years of happiness. There never was
a moment when I wanted to be any place other than I was.
There were times of great tragedy, of seeing people killed
and of burying my dearest friends, but all that was part of
the tragedy of our generation. It would not have been any
less if I were not present, and it was some consolation to be
where I could render some little comfort to the men who
had to go through them and to the relatives of those who
paid the big price.</p>

<p>The sense of congenial companionship more than makes
up for the hardships incidental to a campaign. What I
am going to miss most is the friendships I have formed. In
a very special degree I am going to miss Donovan. Nearly
every evening we take our walk together along the river
road that parallels the Rhine. It is the very spot which
Byron selected for description in Childe Harold. The Rhine
turns sharply to the right to make its way through the
gorge of the Siebengebirge. “The castled crag of Drachenfels”
looks down upon the peaceful cloistered isle of Nonnenwerth,
upon pleasant villages and vineyard terraces and
beautiful villas which, with the majestic river, make the
scene one of the most beautiful in the world.</p>

<p>The companionship makes it all the more attractive. This
young Buffalo lawyer who was suddenly called into the
business of war, and has made a name for himself throughout
the American Expeditionary Forces for outstanding
courage and keen military judgment, is a remarkable man.
As a boy he reveled in Thomas Francis Meagher’s “Speech
on the Sword,” and his dream of life was to command an
Irish brigade in the service of the Republic. His dream
came true, for the 69th in this war was larger than the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</span>
Irish Brigade ever was. But it did not come true by mere
dreaming. He is always physically fit, always alert, ready
to do without food, sleep, rest, in the most matter of fact
way, thinking of nothing but the work in hand. He has
mind and manners and varied experience of life and resoluteness
of purpose. He has kept himself clean and sane
and whole for whatever adventure life might bring him, and
he has come through this surpassing adventure with honor
and fame. I like him for his alert mind and just views
and ready wit, for his generous enthusiasms and his whole
engaging personality. The richest gain I have gotten out
of the war is the friendship of William J. Donovan.</p>

<p>That is the way I talk about him to myself. When we
are together we always find something to fight about. One
unfailing subject of discussion is which of us is the greater
hero. That sounds rather conceited, and all the more so
when I say that each of us sticks up strongly for himself.
Those infernal youngsters of ours have been telling stories
about both of us, most of which, at least those that concern
myself, attest the loyalty of my friends better than their
veracity. There is only one way to take it—as a joke. If
either of us gets a clipping in which his name is mentioned
he brandishes it before company under the nose of the other
challenging him to produce some proof of being as great
a hero. The other day Captain Ryan gave Donovan an
editorial about him from a paper in Watertown, N. Y. It
was immediately brought to mess, and Donovan thought
he had scored a triumph, but I countered with a quotation
from a letter which said that my picture, jewelled with electric
lights, had a place of honor in the window of a saloon
on 14th Street. Donovan surrendered.</p>

<p>I got a letter from Tom Reilley, who is back in New
York, and disgusted with life because he is no longer with
us; and he gave me some choice ammunition. “Father
Duffy,” he said, “You are certainly a wonderful man.
Your press agents are working overtime. Recently you
have been called the ‘Miracle Man,’ thus depriving George<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</span>
Stallings of the title. In the newspaper league you have
Bill Donovan beat by 9,306 columns. I wish you would tell
me, How do you wade through a stream of machine gun
bullets? And that little stunt of yours of letting high explosive
shells bounce off your chest—you could make your
fortune in a circus doing that for the rest of your life.”</p>

<p>It is all very amusing now, but it is going to be extremely
embarrassing when we get back amongst civilians where
people take these things too seriously. They kept me too
long as a professor of metaphysics to fit me for the proper
enjoyment of popularity. Donovan says that after his final
duties to the regiment are finished he is going to run away
from it all and go off with his wife on a trip to Japan.</p>

<p>On April the second we boarded our trains for Brest—the
first leg on the way home. We had a happy trip across
France in the most comfortably arranged troop trains that
Europe ever saw; remained three or four days at Brest, and
sailed for Hoboken, the regiment being split up on two
ships. Our headquarters and the first six companies were
on the <em>Harrisburg</em>, formerly the <em>City of Paris</em> in the American
Line. Jim Collintine used to sail on it and is very enthusiastic
in his praises. It is funny to hear him telling a
seasick bunch “Ain’t it a grand boat! A lovely boat! Sure
you wouldn’t know you were aboard her. And she’s the
woise ould thing. She’s been over this thrip so often that
if niver a man put a hand to her wheel she’d pick her own
way out and niver stop or veer till she turned her nose
into the dock, like an ould horse findin’ its way to the
manger.”</p>

<p>After the men had found their sea-legs we had a happy
trip. We spent Easter Sunday aboard, celebrating it in
holy fashion.</p>

<p>It was a happy throng that stood on the decks of the
<em>Harrisburg</em> on the morning of April 21st, gazing at the
southern shores of Long Island, and then the Statue of
Liberty, and the massive towering structures that announce
to incoming voyagers the energy and daring of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</span>
Western Republic. Then down the bay came the welcoming
flotilla bearing relatives, friends and benefactors.</p>

<p>The number of our welcomers and the ampleness of their
enthusiasm were the first indications we had of the overwhelming
welcome which was to be ours during the following
two weeks. I do not intend to speak here at any length,
of these events, as the gentlemen of the press have described
them better than I could ever hope to do. The freedom
of the city was conferred upon Colonel Donovan and his
staff by Mayor Hylan and the Board of Alderman; and a
dinner was given to the officers by the Mayor’s Committee
headed by the genial Commissioner Rodman Wanamaker.
Our own Board of Trustees, the most generous and efficient
lot of backers that any fighting outfit ever had since war
began, gave the whole regiment a dinner at the Hotel Commodore
which set a new record in the history of repasts.
Our brethren of the 69th New York Guard also gave a
dinner to the officers of the 165th. And Colonel Donovan
and I enjoyed the hospitality of the Press Association and
the Lamb’s Club. Another big baseball game, through the
good will of the owners of the Giants, added fresh funds
to the money at my disposal for needy families. My own
fellow townsmen in the Bronx prepared a public reception,
for which every last detail was arranged except the weather;
but I was prouder than ever of them when they put the
thing through in good soldier fashion, regardless of the
meanest day of wind and rain that New York ever saw
in the month of May.</p>

<p>There was nothing that imagination could conceive or
energy perform that our Board of Trustees was not willing
to do for us. Dan Brady, who has neglected his business
for the past two years to look after the 69th, and
all the rest of them, devoted themselves entirely to furthering
our well-being and our glory. The only thing I have
against Dan is that he makes me work as hard as himself,
and bosses me around continually. At one of the dinners I
said that if Dan Brady had taken up the same kind of a job<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</span>
that I had, he would be a bishop by now; but if he were
my Bishop I’d be a Baptist or a Presbyterian; in some
Church anyway, that doesn’t have Bishops.</p>

<p>The part of our reception which I enjoyed most of all
was the parade up Fifth Avenue. The whole regiment
shared in it, including the extra battalion, seven hundred
strong, of men who had been invalided home, and others
of our wounded who had a place of honor on the grandstand.
Archbishop Hayes, who had blessed us as we left
the Armory, Mayor Hylan, men prominent in State and
City, in Army and Navy affairs, united to pay their tribute
of praise to the old regiment. And thousands and thousands
of people on the stands cheered and cheered and
cheered, so that for five miles the men walked through a din
of applause, till the band playing the American and Irish
airs could scarce be heard.</p>

<p>It was a deserved tribute to a body of citizen soldiers
who had played such a manful part in battle for the service
of the Republic. The appreciation that the country pays
to its war heroes is for the best interest of the State. I am
not a militarist, nor keen for military glory. But as long as
liberties must be defended, and oppression or aggression
put down, there must always be honor paid to that spirit
in men which makes them willing to die for a righteous
cause. Next after reason and justice, it is the highest
quality in citizens of a state.</p>

<p>Our fathers in this republic, in their poverty and lowliness,
founded many institutions, ecclesiastical, financial,
charitable, which have grown stronger with the years. One
of these institutions was a military organization, which they
passed on to us with the flag of the fifty silver furls. To
these we have added nine more in the latest war of our
country. As it was borne up the Avenue flanked by that
other banner whose stars of gold commemorated the six
hundred and fifty dead heroes of the regiment, and surrounded
by three thousand veterans, I felt that in the breasts
of generous and devoted youths that gazed upon them there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</span>
arose a determination that if, in their generation, the Republic
ever needed defenders, they too would face the perils
of battle in their country’s cause.</p>

<p>Men pass away, but institutions survive. In time we shall
all go to join our comrades who gave up their lives in
France. But in our own generation, when the call came, we
accepted the flag of our fathers; we have added to it new
glory and renown—and we pass it on.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>Fifth Avenue held a memorable crowd on the afternoon
of the ninth of March, 1917. There were old women there
in whose eyes was the eager light that only the thought of
a son can cause to glow; there were proud old men—some of
them with battered blue garrison-caps, and badges that told
of service in the War between the States—there were wives,
mothers, children—all waiting, in jubilant and affectionate expectation,
the sound of a band playing “Garryowen” and the
sight of a flag fluttering from a pole so covered with battle-furls
as to glisten in the sunlight like a bar of silver.</p>

<p>The Sixty-ninth Regiment was back from the border. Escorted
by its old friend, the Seventh New York, the Regiment
marched nearly eight hundred strong, down the Avenue and
east to the Armory. The crowd—or a large part of it—followed,
and soon families separated for months were reunited.
When the Sixty-ninth was mustered out of service
that March day, after months of arduous service on the Mexican
Border, it numbered 783 men. Almost immediately it lost
some three hundred officers and men. This was in accordance
with War Department orders and the National Defense
Act of June 3rd, 1916, which provided that men with dependant
relatives should be discharged from the service. Men
were lost also because of the system, now discontinued, by
which a soldier in the National Guard was furloughed to the
reserve after three years of active service.</p>

<p>So in the early Spring of 1917, with participation in the
European War a certainty, the Sixty-ninth Regiment found
itself far below war strength, having lost a great number of
men whom experience and training had made ideal soldiers.
At once a recruiting campaign was instituted, but a recruiting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</span>
campaign of a special kind. The Sixty-ninth has never found
it at all difficult to fill its ranks—when it was under Southern
fire in the Sixties it was brought up to war strength nine times.
But the purpose in view now was to bring into the regiment
men who would, in every purpose and way—physically, mentally
and morally—keep up its ancient and honorable standards.
It was easy enough to enlist hundreds of strong men
who could be developed into good soldiers. But this was
not the object of the recruiting of the Spring of 1917. It
was desired to enlist strong, intelligent, decent-living men,
men whose sturdy Americanism was strengthened and vivified
by their Celtic blood, men who would be worthy successors of
those unforgotten patriots who at Bloody Ford and on Marye’s
Heights earned the title of “The Fighting Irish.”</p>

<p>The Regiment set its own standards in selecting recruits.
In weight, for example, one hundred and twenty-eight pounds
was established as the minimum. And if some honest man
with broad shoulders and a knockout in each fist was unable to
read ACXUROKY on a card hung thirty feet away—why,
the examining physicians were instructed not to be overly
meticulous in their work. But if the candidate, having every
physical perfection, seemed to be the kind of man who would
be out of harmony with the things for which the Sixty-ninth
stands and has always stood, then the rigorous application of
some of the qualifying tests invariably resulted in his rejection.</p>

<p>When, on April 6th, 1917, President Wilson declared that a
state of war existed between the United States and Germany,
his words found the Sixty-ninth Regiment ready, its ranks
filled to war strength with soldiers of whom the men who
fought at Gettysburg and Chancellorsville would not be
ashamed. There was new intensity in the nightly drills; there
was new fervor in the resolve of every man, veteran of the
Border and recruit alike, to make the Regiment as nearly
perfect a fighting unit as possible.</p>

<p>The 6th of April is a date which no American soldier will
forget. And almost equally memorable is the 15th day of
July of the same year—the day on which the National Guard
was called into Federal Service. The Sixty-ninth regiment,
2002 strong, scarcely felt the heat of that torrid midsummer,
so intent were all the men on preparing themselves for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</span>
great adventure, and so passionately eager were they for the
call to service over-seas.</p>

<p>On the 5th of August the Regiment, still retaining the numerical
designation which is permanently engraved upon the
tablets of our nation’s history, was drafted into the Regular
Army of the United States. This was a step nearer to the
firing line—made, accordingly, with enthusiasm. And on the
25th day of August came the electrifying news that the Sixty-ninth
Regiment had been selected as the first New York National
Guard organization to be sent to the war in vanguard
of the American Expeditionary Force.</p>

<p>The circumstances in which the announcement was made
to the regiment were striking. It was a boiling Saturday afternoon
and officers and men were exhausted from the exercises
of the morning—a Divisional inspection in Central Park. The
regiment marched through the dusty streets and ascended the
steps into the Armory to learn that they were not to be immediately
dismissed, but were to stay on the drill floor or in
the Company rooms. Lieutenant Colonel Latham R. Reed had
gone to Governor’s Island to attend an important conference,
and officers and men were ordered to await his return. Everyone
hopefully awaited the arrival of splendid tidings, and the
weariness seemed to pass away.</p>

<p>When Lieutenant Colonel Reed returned, he called a meeting
of his staff and the Battalion and Company Commanders,
and told them such details as were then obtainable of the
great honor which had come to the regiment they loved. There
were present Major William J. Donovan, Major William B.
Stacom, Major Timothy J. Moynahan, Captain George McAdie,
Captain Thomas T. Reilley, Captain William Kennelly,
Captain James A. McKenna, Jr., Captain Alexander E. Anderson,
Captain Michael A. Kelly, Captain James J. Archer, Captain
James G. Finn, Captain Van S. Merle-Smith, Captain
John P. Hurley, and Captain William T. Doyle. They
heard the good news with undisguised delight and at once proceeded
to prepare for the necessary intensive training.</p>

<p>But as great as was their delight, it was clouded with one
regret. And that regret was felt also by every enlisted man.
They all knew that the Regiment had been the first selected to
go abroad not because of what it had done in the Civil War,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</span>
nor because it was representative of what was best in the
citizenship of our nation’s greatest city. It had been selected,
after a long and searching examination of the military resources
of the country, because its record in the most recent
important test—the Mexican Border Campaign—showed it to
be the best trained and equipped fighting unit that America
possessed. And the man who had done more than all others
to bring the Regiment to this point, the man who during the
long strenuous months on the Border had moulded it after his
own ideal pattern of soldierly efficiency—that man was absent
from the conference at which was announced the momentous
news. There was not an officer in the conference room, there
was not an enlisted man on the drill floor that day, who did
not think of Colonel William N. Haskell—of the joy with
which he would lead his beloved Regiment into the Great War,
of the joy with which that Regiment would follow him across
the ocean and over the parapet and through the German lines
to the Kaiser’s palace. There was not an officer or man who
did not recall his last words when he was ordered to another
duty “I want to lead the 69th Regiment into a fight.”</p>

<p>Colonel Haskell was absent from this historic conference.
He had been lent, not given to the Regiment, and now the
Government claimed his valuable services to solve some of the
problems of the new National Army. But he was present
in spirit—in the thoughts of everyone in the building and in
the fitness he had given to the Regiment’s personnel.</p>

<p>Soon after the announcement that the Sixty-ninth Regiment
was to be one of the very first into battle it was learned that
the Regiment was to be brought up to a strength of 3500,
according to the scheme which the French military experts
had developed from their hard-bought experience with the
conditions of modern warfare. It would have been a task
gratifying to the whole Regiment, including Colonel Charles
Hine, who now was placed in command, to build up the
Regiment to this size by means of the recruiting methods
which already had proved so successful. But it had been decided
by higher authorities that the Regiment’s numbers should
be augmented by additions from other New York National
Guard organizations. Accordingly, one day in August, 1917,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</span>
there arrived at the armory the first of the new increments—332
men from the 7th New York Infantry.</p>

<p>The ties that bind the 7th and the 69th are ancient and
strong. The friendship between the two organizations has
often been strikingly manifested. It was much in evidence
when the New York National Guard was stationed on the
Border. But it has never been displayed more convincingly
than on the day that the men from the 7th joined the 69th.
Escorted to the doors of the armory by the rest of the 7th, led
by Colonel Willard C. Fisk, the men found the entire 69th
Regiment assembled to welcome them. They were made at
home; they found it no difficult task to orient themselves to
their new surroundings. Without any disloyalty to the venerable
regiment they had left, they accepted as their own the
traditions and standards of the 69th and became not a distinct
group added to the Regiment but a vital part of it.</p>

<p>On the 20th of August the 69th Regiment, now 2,500 strong,
again marched through New York, and again an enormous
crowd witnessed and followed the march. But this crowd,
unlike that of the 9th of March previous, was not composed of
people rejoicing over a long-sought reunion. The same men,
women and children who had been present on the 9th of
March to welcome the soldiers returning from the Rio Grande
were present and they were as proud as, or prouder than before.
But faces that had been happy were fearful now and
the gestures were of farewell. Wives and mothers looked
at the bright ranks with smiling anguish. The 69th was
marching to the ferry to cross the East River and entrain for
Camp Albert L. Mills, near Mineola, New York. It was the
first move toward the front, to win new battle-rings for the
pole that saw Cold Harbor and Bloody Ford.</p>

<p>There were many new and strange experiences in store
for the officers and men during the period of intensive training
on Hempstead Plains. A carefully planned schedule provided
for drill and instruction enough to fill nearly every minute
of the day. Much of the work was repetition for those of
the men who had seen service on the Border, but they entered
into it in a way that showed they thoroughly appreciated its
value. There was also training in those phases of offensive
and defensive warfare which have been developed since August,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</span>
1914. This work came in for an especially large share
of attention. It was no longer a mere drill; it was active
preparation for the use of what is, in spite of trench mortar,
cannon, bomb and machine, the most effective weapon of modern
warfare. The Regiment was instructed in the use of the
bayonet by reserve officers who had acquired their knowledge
from men with actual experience at the front. Cold steel
propelled by Irishmen was said to be what the Germans chiefly
feared and every effort was made to make sure that the 69th
should not, through lack of practice, be less skillful with the
bayonet than were the Dublin Fusileers and the Connaught
Rangers. Visitors to the camp who were so fortunate as to
be present at the bayonet drill were greatly impressed by the
dexterity which the soldiers had gained in a few weeks, and
by the intense realism which pervaded the exercise.</p>

<p>And now the Regiment gained, from day to day, the increments
necessary to bring it up to the prescribed war
strength of 3500. The men from the 7th had already been
assimilated as privates and non-commissioned officers; they
had become an integral part of the 69th (for only on paper was
the name 165th in use). The 23rd, 14th, 71st and 12th now
sent their delegations.</p>

<p>In most cases, the selection of the men in the various
armories was made with perfect fairness, the prescribed number
of sergeants, corporals and privates being arbitrarily taken
from the ranks. But in certain companies it was soon evident
that the officers had yielded to the natural temptation to endeavor
to retain in their commands their best trained non-coms.
Here was, for instance, a corporal to be taken from
Blank Company of the Dash Regiment. By strict adherence to
the letter of the law, Corporal Smith, a soldier of stainless
record, with three month’s Border service to his credit, should
be the man to entrain for Camp Mills. But here was Private
Jones, a recent recruit, not especially happy in the Dash
Regiment and probably not likely to be homesick for it if
sent away. Why not let him sew a couple of stripes on the
sleeves of his new blouse, and go on his way rejoicing.</p>

<p>This is the way some Company Commanders reasoned. And
as a result, the 69th Regiment found that among its new
members were some Sergeants and Corporals whose military<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</span>
knowledge included little more than the manual of arms, and
privates who were physically, morally, and mentally unfit for
the service. It was not to be expected that these men would
be received with overwhelming enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Many of the soldiers received from other regiments—most
of them in fact, were valuable additions to the 69th and at
once proved their usefulness by merging with the rest of the
outfit and working for the soldierly perfection of the whole
body. Of the others—well, some of them were reformed by
thorough disciplinary action, and others were allowed to drift
back into civilian life by means of liberal use of dependency
and surgeon’s certificate of disability.</p>

<p>So many soldiers were lost of those acquired from other
regiments that although the time for sailing was almost at
hand it was considered advisable to institute another recruiting
campaign. There was no difficulty in gaining the desired
number of recruits; the prospect of immediate service in
France with the most famous regiment in America brought
to the Armory doors three times as many candidates as could
be accepted.</p>

<p>Now the wives and mothers who thronged the dusty Company
streets on Saturday and Sunday afternoons began to
show stronger anxiety, to look with new intensity into the eyes
of their soldiers as they bade them farewell and returned to
the city. For the time for sailing was at hand—no one knew
just when or just where the Regiment was going, but all felt
it was a question only of days or hours.</p>

<p>Twice secret orders to sail were received at Regimental
Headquarters, and twice these orders were hastily countermanded.
The suspense began to tell on officers and men, to
tell even more, perhaps on those to whom they had again and
again to say good bye. At last, on the night of October 25th,
Major Donovan led the first battalion through the dark camp
and down the silent lanes to the long train that was to take
them to Montreal.</p>

<p>And now there were no crowds, there was no music. It was
a journey more momentous, greater in historical importance,
than the Regiment’s triumphant return from the Border, than
its flower and flag decked setting forth for Camp Mills. But
it was not, like those memorable events, a time for music and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</span>
pomp. The feeling of the officers and men was one of stern
delight, of that strange religious exaltation with which men
of Celtic race and faith go into battle, whether the arena be
Vinegar Hill, Fontenoy, or Rouge Boquet. As the trainful
of happy warriors steamed through the first leagues of the
journey to the Front, Father Duffy, the Regiment’s beloved
Chaplain, passed from car to car hearing confessions and
giving absolution. Rosaries—the last dear gift of mothers and
sweethearts—were taken out and by squads, platoons and companies
the soldiers told their beads. There was little sleep on
the 69th special for Montreal that night—officers and men
were too excited, too exalted for that. They had entered at
last on the adventure of their lives.</p>

<p>General O’Ryan had said that a soldier is a man who always
wants to be elsewhere than where he is. This is not true of
soldiers of the race to which General O’Ryan’s name indicates
that he belongs. They want to be elsewhere—only when they
are in some peaceful place. If the Regiment had been restless
before, the second and third Battalions were doubly so
after they had seen four companies of their comrades go away.</p>

<p>But they had not long to wait. On the night of October
29th, the <em>America</em> (formerly the <em>Amerika</em> of the Hamburg-American
line) pulled out of New York Harbor. There was
no khaki on her decks; the only figures to be seen were sailors
and deck-hands. But as soon as the vessel was out of range of
spying Teutonic eyes, soldiers poured out of every hatchway.
And as they thronged the deck-space available and looked their
last for a long time at the lights along the fast receding shore,
they showed a contentment, a mirth that amazed the crew,
long accustomed to transporting troops.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with you fellows?” asked one sailor.
“Ain’t you sorry to be leaving your homes? Didn’t you ever
hear there was such things as submarines?” He had helped
carry over all sort of soldiers, he said, Regulars, Marines and
Guardsmen, but he had never before seen passengers so seemingly
indifferent to the grief of leavetaking and the perils of
the wartime sea. He couldn’t understand it.</p>

<p>He might have been able to understand it if he had read
Chesteron’s “Ballad of the White Horse.” For in that wise
poem is an explanation of the psychology of the 69th New<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</span>
York, an explanation of the singular phenomenon of soldiers
leaving their dear ones and setting out over menacing seas to
desperate battle in a strange land as merrily as if they were
planning merely an evening at Coney Island. Chesterton
wrote:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<h3>II</h3>

<p>The First Battalion’s voyage to France was more interesting
than that of the main body of the regiment or of Companies
L and M, who followed them in a few days. Sailing
from Montreal on the <em>Tunisian</em> at 8 on the morning of October
27th, they landed at Liverpool, England, on November 10.
There they entrained for Southhampton, reaching that city
late in the night. In the night of the 11th they crossed the
English Channel to Havre, and after a few hours’ rest they
were packed into open box-cars for their cold journey across
France. They detrained at Sauvoy on November 15.</p>

<p>The voyage of the good ship <em>America</em> was made over a
sea so glassy-smooth that sea-sickness was an impossibility.
The boat-drills, the rules against smoking or showing lights
on deck at night and the constant watch for submarines (a
work which was put wholly in the hands of the 69th Regiment,
and executed by them with unflagging devotion) served
to remind the men that, peaceful as the blue water looked, they
were actually in the war already.</p>

<p>The discomforts of a crowded ship could not daunt the
spirits of the men of the 69th. The dark holes far below the
water-level in which they were tightly packed rang with song
and laughter every night until taps sounded. There were concerts
on deck and in the mess-room every night, except when
the ship’s course was through the danger zone and silence was
enforced. If there is left in the Atlantic Ocean a mermaid
who cannot now sing “Over There,” “Goodbye Broadway,
Hello France,” “Mother Machree,” and “New York Town,”
it is not the fault of the 69th New York.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</span></p>

<p>And yet mirth was not the sole occupation of these soldiers,
exhilarated as they were by the prospects of battle. During
the day, one could find little groups gathered on hatchways
and in corners, studying, from little manuals they had bought,
such subjects as the new bayonet work and grenade throwing.
The talk of the men was very seldom of the homes
and friends they had left behind, it was nearly always of the
prospect of battle. They talked of what front they might be
expected to hold, with what troops they might be trained, and,
above all, of how soon they were to go into action. They
discussed such methods and instruments of modern warfare as
they knew with the keen interest of those who are soldiers
by their own choice.</p>

<p>Those who do not know the 69th Regiment would have been
puzzled by the spectacle presented by the main deck amidships
every afternoon and evening. There could be seen a line of
soldiers, as long as the mess-line, waiting their turn to go to
confession to the Regimental Chaplain, Father Francis P.
Duffy. And every morning—not on Sundays alone—there
was a crowd at the same spot, where, on an altar resting on
two nail kegs, Father Duffy said Mass.</p>

<p>The voyage passed without any sight of hostile sea or aircraft,
and after two weeks the <em>America</em> came to anchor in
the beautiful harbor of Brest. That is, it seemed a beautiful
harbor at first, with its long white quay and its miles of dark
green shore picked out with venerable gray stone buildings.
But as day succeeded day with nothing for the soldiers to
do but tramp the decks and yearn for the feel of sod under
their hobnails, the view began to lose some of its beauty.
There were two weeks on the open sea—these soon passed.
But the week in Brest Harbor, in tantalizing sight of land,
separated by only half a mile of green evil-smelling stagnation
from shops and cafes and homes—that was cruel and unusual
punishment.</p>

<p>When, after six days a detail for the hard work of loading
freight cars was formed, every man in the regiment volunteered—and
this sort of a detail usually is eagerly avoided.
The volunteers who were accepted had little to reward them
except the pleasure of being upon comparatively dry land.
They were given no chance to taste the delights of the seaside<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</span>
city. When their task of unloading and loading baggage was
finished, they and the rest of their shipmates learned what
“Hommes 36-40, Chevaux 8” meant. From 40 to 50 men
entered the waiting box-cars, with hard tack and canned corn-beef
(Corn Willie) to feed them, and their own blankets to
protect them from the hardness of the floors and the cold
blasts that swept in at the open sides.</p>

<p>Three days and three nights of such travelling as no soldier
of the 69th can ever forget, and they were at the village of
Sauvoy, in the Department of Meuse. From this point a hike
of some two hours brought them to the tiny village of Naives-en-Blois.
Here was to be the new home of Regimental Headquarters,
Headquarters Company, Supply Company and Company
B. The other companies (including those of the First
Battalion, which had arrived in the district on the fifteenth
of the month) were quartered in the nearby villages of
Sauvoy, Bovée, Vacon, Broussey and Villeroi.</p>

<p>The Regiment was put not in barracks, but in billets. Now
billets, to those of the men who had done guard duty in upper
New York State during the previous Spring, meant comfortable
bedrooms, buckwheat cakes with syrup for breakfast, and
the society of good natured farming people. But billeting in
the European sense of the term, meant something different,
as they soon found out. It meant that certain householders,
in return for the payment of a few sous per man per twenty-four
hours, were obliged to allow soldiers to sleep in their
stables, barns or other outhouses. They were not obliged to
furnish any food, light or heat. They were not obliged even
to mend the roofs or walls of the shelters. Straw for filling
bedsacks was furnished to the soldiers, and they were fairly
launched on their first winter in France.</p>

<p>It was a winter of unprecedented severity. A freezing wind
blew through the great holes in the tumble-down sheds where
the men slept, covering them, night after night, with snow.
They learned many soldierly things. How to make blouse
and overcoat supplement the thin army blankets, for instance.
How to keep shoes from freezing in the night by sleeping on
them. How to dress and undress in the dark—for lamps
were unknown and candles forbidden.</p>

<p>These things the soldiers taught themselves, or were taught<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</span>
by circumstances during their stay in Naives-en-Blois and environs.
Their work consisted of close order drill, guard duty,
and the thorough and much needed policing of the ancient village
street.</p>

<p>Now, Naives was near the front—so near that the guns
could clearly be heard when the wind blew in the right direction.
This was cheering for the men, but as there were indications
of a strengthening of the German lines at this point,
with a possible view to an offensive, it was necessary to use
the district for troops whose training had been completed;
and, according to the new European standards, that of the
69th had not yet begun. So it was necessary for the Regiment—indeed,
for the whole 42nd Division, which then had its
headquarters in the nearby city of Vaucouleurs—to give place
to seasoned French troops. So the men made their packs,
the wagons were loaded, and the Regiment changed station
from the 4th to the 5th area.</p>

<p>After two days of hiking (very easy hiking it seemed, in the
light of later experiences) the Regiment arrived, on December
13, in the historic town of Grand. Here, centuries before, the
conquering Romans had encamped, one hundred thousand
strong. The ruins of the mighty ampitheatre that they built
still stands, and the tower of the great church was once part
of a fort. It was Caesar himself who planned the broad roads
on which our Regiment drilled, and Caesar’s soldiers who
made them. In this venerable church Father Duffy said midnight
Mass on Christmas, and all the town came to see these
strange, gentle, brave, mirthful, pious American soldiers, who,
coming from a new land to fight for France, practiced France’s
ancient faith with such devotion. The Regimental colors were
in the chancel, flanked by the tricolor. The 69th band was
present, and some French soldier-violinists. A choir of
French women sang hymns in their own language, the American
soldiers sang a few in English, and French and American
joined in the universal Latin of “Venite, Adoremus Dominum.”
It was a memorable Midnight Mass—likely to be remembered
longer even than that which Father Duffy had said on
the Mexican Border just a year previous, which troops for
fifty miles around had crossed the prairies to attend.</p>

<p>Now it was considered advisable for the Division to proceed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</span>
to the 6th area. This meant a hike of some four days
and nights. Accordingly, at 8 on the morning of December
26th, the Regiment passed through the main street of Grand
and out over the ancient Roman road.</p>

<p>This hike has become so famous—or so infamous—because
of the undeniable sufferings of those who took part in it that it
needs no detailed description here. It must by any impartial
historian be admitted that during it the men of the 69th Regiment
were insufficiently fed and shod, that they endured great
and unnecessary pains and privations. It must also be admitted
that they bore these trials with a cheerfulness which amazed
the French civilians through whose villages they passed, accustomed
as were these people to soldiers of almost every
human race. They would crush their bleeding feet into their
frozen, broken-soled hobnails of a black morning, and breakfastless
start out, with a song on their lips, to climb the foothills
of the Vosges Mountains through the heart of a blizzard.
At noon (shifting their feet about to keep the blood moving)
they would (if it was one of the lucky days) have a slice of
bread or two pieces of hardtack for noon mess. At night they
would have a sleep instead of supper. But they were never
dispirited; they were never too cold, too hungry or too weary
to sing or to teach the innocent French villagers strange bits
of New York slang.</p>

<p>No man in the 69th Regiment “fell out” during that terrible
hike. But many fell down. That is, no one, because of heart-breaking
weariness, or faintness or lameness went to the roadside
and waited for the ambulance to pick him up. Those who
finished the journey in ambulances or trucks did so because
they had fallen senseless in the deep snow, unable to speak or
move. And wherever the Regiment passed there were bloody
tracks in the white roadway.</p>

<p>“That hike made Napoleon’s retreat from Moscow look
like a Fifth Avenue parade,” said one of the medical officers
serving during this period. And many an observer compared
the Regiment to Washington’s foot-sore soldiers at Valley
Forge. It was only the indomitable spirit of the Irish American
fighting man that kept the Regiment afoot through those
four tragic days.</p>

<p>The Regiment that arrived in Longeau on the afternoon of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</span>
December 29th looked different from the Regiment that had
left Grand four days before. To judge them by their gait
and their faces, the men had aged twenty years. But their
hearts were unchanged. As they stood in the deep snow,
the ice-crusted packs still on their bruised shoulders, they had
a laughing word for every pretty face at a Longeau window.
The weary bandsmen started a defiant air, and the Regiment
joined in with a roar. The song was “The Good Old Summertime.”</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>Longeau, which with the surrounding villages constituted
the Regiment’s new home, is a small farming town in the
Haute Marne District. Unlike those of Naives, its houses are
strongly built and in excellent preservation, and the billets in
which (awaiting the completion of barracks) the troops were
stationed were dry, warm and comfortable. As soon as
possible, the Regiment moved into the new barracks built in
the outskirts of Longeau and nearby villages, and was thus
more nearly consolidated than it had previously been since its
arrival in France.</p>

<p>In Longeau, the 69th Regiment was destined to receive
much more practical training for the trenches than it had received
in Camp Mills, Naives or Grand. These last two towns
had really been merely stopping places, Longeau was a training
camp. The most important event of the stay in Longeau
was the advent of Colonel John W. Barker. Colonel Hine was
withdrawn from his post with the regiment early in January,
in order that he might take part in the transportation work
for which he was especially fitted. He was succeeded on January
12th by Colonel John W. Barker, National Army. Colonel
Barker was an up-state New Yorker, who graduated from
West Point in the class of ’09. He had served in the Regular
Infantry ever since in Cuba, the Philippines and on the Mexican
Border. He saw considerable active service against the
Indians, after taking part in almost the last of the Indian fight
at Leach Creek, Minnesota.</p>

<p>Four years ago, he was recommended by his arm of the
service to represent the Infantry for one year’s duty with a
French Infantry Regiment. He was in France on this duty
when the great war broke out, and remained as a member of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</span>
our military organization until the arrival of the American
Expeditionary Forces. Then he joined the staff of the Commander
in Chief as General Staff Officer, 5th Section. He
served General Headquarters in this capacity until personally
selected by the Commander in Chief to command the 165th
Infantry.</p>

<p>Now the regiment began to take the form of a modern
fighting organization. It was Colonel Barker’s task to bring
it into conformation with the new Tables of Organization,
and to this task the best energies of himself and his staff were
immediately devoted.</p>

<p>The specialized platoons (pioneers, trench mortar, one
pound cannon) were now organized and intensively trained.
Competent enlisted men from these platoons were sent to the
schools newly established by General Headquarters and given
the advantage of instruction by officers who had gained their
knowledge of the subjects in actual warfare conditions. Hand
grenades were supplied, and every man taught their effective
use. Steel helmets now replaced the historic felt campaign
hats. To every man were issued two gas masks, one French
gas mask and one English box respirator. By means of constant
drill in the rapid adjustment of these masks, under the
direction of an officer who had specialized in the subject, the
men acquired a proficiency in their use which saved many a
life in the Lunéville and Baccarat Sectors and during the weeks
of desperate fighting on the banks of the Suippes and the
Marne.</p>

<p>It was during the stay in Longeau that the 69th Regiment
organized its Intelligence Section, the first in the 42nd Division.
Under the direction of the Regimental Intelligence
Officer, Lieutenant Basil B. Elmer, U. S. R., there was organized
and trained a group of scouts, observers, map-makers
and snipers so expert in detecting and hindering the movements
of the enemy that they were several times, in the course
of the action that came later, asked to attach themselves permanently
to the Headquarters of the 42nd Division, in order
that they might serve as instructors to the other regimental
intelligence sections.</p>

<p>There were several changes in the personnel of the Regiment’s
administrative staff. Lieutenant Colonel Reed had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</span>
been selected for Staff College, and the Regiment never got
him back. Captain William Doyle, who had served as Regimental
Adjutant in Camp Mills, had been relieved while the
regiment was in Naives-en-Blois, and his place taken by Captain
Alexander E. Anderson, long in command of Company
E. Now Captain Anderson was relieved as Adjutant and
placed in command of Headquarters Company. Its former
commander, Captain Walter E. Powers, for several years Adjutant
of the Regiment, went to the Headquarters of the 42nd
Division, leaving an enviable record for absolute efficiency in
company and regimental administration. His abilities were
soon recognized by his commission as Major and appointment
as Divisional Adjutant. Captain Doyle was attached to Brigade
Headquarters. Captain Anderson’s work was taken over
by Lieutenant William F. McKenna, who was appointed Acting
Adjutant, an office which he had filled during part of the
Border campaign.</p>

<p>The training of officers and men never flagged while the
Regiment was stationed in Longeau. Battalion and company
commanders, Lieutenants and enlisted men were sent for
brief periods to the special schools instituted by General Headquarters
for their benefit, and on their return imparted to
others the knowledge they had gained. There were lectures
and quizzes every evening in the barracks, supplementary to
the instruction received every morning and afternoon in the
drill field and on the range. A number of American officers
who had seen service at the front were now attached to the
Regiment, and their first hand information gave new actuality
to the daily work.</p>

<p>The training of the Regiment for the action in which they
were soon to take part received new and strong impetus during
the month of February by the arrival in camp of the 32nd
Battalion of Chasseurs. These famous French soldiers, who
had been in violent action ever since 1914, proved to be the
most useful instructors for the men of the 69th. On the
range and during the long hours of grenade throwing and open
and trench warfare practice, their instruction, example and
companionship was a constant incentive to the American soldiers.
And it was a proud day for the 69th Regiment when
its soldiers perceived that in rifle marksmanship and in grenade<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</span>
throwing they had succeeded in proving their superiority to
their veteran instructors.</p>

<p>From February 7th to February 13th the Regiment took
part in manoeuvres in which it was opposed by the 166th Infantry.
These manoeuvres took place in the hilly country
around Longeau and had as their ultimate objective the seizure
and holding of the town of Brennes. This difficult strategic
task was eventually accomplished.</p>

<p>Now the desire of the men for immediate participation in
the action, the lure of which had drawn them across the ocean,
was so strong as to amount to an obsession. It was evident
to any competent observer that the whole Division was ready
to render valuable service, as thoroughly trained as any unit
in the American contingent. This was evidently the opinion
of those who directed the movement of American troops, for
on February 16th, 17th and 18th the Regiment marched to
Langres, under orders to entrain for the city of Lunéville,
in the Department of Meurthe-et-Moselle, for training with
French troops in the line—that is, for actual duty in the
trenches.</p>

<p>Lunéville was the largest town in which the Regiment had
been stationed since its arrival in France. Some of the companies
were put in billets, and some in the Stanislas Barracks,
a magnificent stone building in the center of the town. Regimental
Headquarters was established in the Stanislas Palace,
a building which had previously housed the Administrative
staffs of some of the French regiments who since 1914 had
done brilliant work in retarding the German advance.</p>

<p>Now the Regiment was placed under the tactical orders of
the General commanding the 164th Division of the French
Army, the Division then occupying what was known as the
Lunéville Sector. On February 21st, the 1st and 2nd Battalions,
Headquarters Company and Machine Gun Company
paraded in the central square of Lunéville and were reviewed
by Major General Bassilière, then commander of the 17th
French Army Corps. A few days later, the Regiment was
made happy by learning that orders to go to the front had
been received. On February 27th and 28th respectively, Companies
D and B marched to their posts in the front line<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</span>
trenches, relieving companies of the 15th Group of Chasseurs
of the French Army.</p>

<p>And now came a chapter in the history of the 69th Regiment
which blotted out from the minds of officers and men
all the hard work of the Camp Mills training period, all the
privations and discomforts of the ocean trip and the journey
across blizzard-beleagured France. The 69th was actually in
the fighting—it was called “a period of training in the
trenches,” but it was no time of sham-battles and manoeuvres.
It was, in fact, an initiation into battle, by way of what was
(up to the time of the 42nd Division’s entry into it) a quiet
sector.</p>

<p>A “quiet sector” is one in which the German and French
lines are separated from each other by a considerable distance—sometimes
as much as five kilometers—in which there is no
immediate objective for which the troops on either side are
striving, in which, finally, shots are seldom fired, the opposing
forces being content merely to hold their trenches almost
undisturbed. These are also termed “rest sectors,” and the
task of holding them is given either to troops wearied by
participation in great battles or to troops fresh from the drill
field and lacking in experience in actual warfare.</p>

<p>Nothing could have been more idyllic than the Rouge-Bouquet-Chaussailles
Subsector of the Lunéville Sector when
Company D marched to its strong point before dawn on the
morning of February 27th. The subsector is heavily wooded
and almost clear of underbrush. As the company marched up
the hill through groves of birch, pine, spruce, and fir, and saw
to right and left little summer houses, benches, tables and
dugout entrances elaborately decorated with rustic woodwork
they were rather shocked by the idyllic beauty of what they
saw. Not for service in such a recreation park had they
crossed the seas. Where were the bursting shells, where was
the liquid fire, where were the bayonets of the charging
Boches? This series of outposts joined by little ditches seemed
at first too much like Central Park to satisfy the battle-hungry
soldiers of the 69th.</p>

<p>The impression of absolute peacefulness was further emphasized
in the course of a thorough reconnaissance of the
subsector made on the morning of the 27th by the Regimental<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</span>
Intelligence Section. They stepped across a ditch and
learned that they had passed the front line trenches—had gone
“over the top.” They wandered about what seemed to be a
deserted pasture and learned that they were in No Man’s
Land.</p>

<p>But this tranquillity was not long to endure. The “Fighting
Irish” lived up to their reputation—they “started something”
at once. Rifles were cracking merrily before Company
D’s men had been at their posts for half an hour. And by
dusk on the evening of the 27th, Corporal Arthur Trayer and
Private John Lyons of Company D had earned the distinction
of being the first soldiers of the Regiment to be wounded. A
high explosive shell burst on striking the roof of a shack
in which they were resting, and the fragments wounded them—not
seriously, but enough to warrant sending them to a hospital
for a few weeks and later awarding them the coveted
wound chevrons.</p>

<p>By the night of the 27th the Chaussaille-Rouge Bouquet
Subsector had lost much of its reputation for quietness. The
Germans may not have known as yet that Americans were in
the trenches opposite them, but they knew at any rate that
some new and aggressive unit had taken over the line, and
they felt in duty bound to show that they were not in the
trenches entirely for a rest curé. So the fight was on.</p>

<p>Regimental Headquarters took over the Regimental Post of
Command at Arbre Haut on March 3rd. Company A occupied
Strong Point Rouge Bouquet from March 1st to March 7th,
Company E from March 7th to 13th, Company L from
March 13th to March 21st. Company B occupied Strong
Point Chaussailles from March 1st to March 6th, Company
H from March 6th to March 12th, Company K from March
12th to March 22nd. Company D occupied Strong Point Sorbiers
from March 1st to March 5th, Company F from March
5th to March 11th, Company I from March 11th to March
17th, Company M from March 17th to March 22nd.</p>

<p>There were many minor casualties during the early part of
this period, but nothing of a really tragic nature occurred until
March 7th. Then came a calamity which would have broken
the morale of any regiment less high-spirited than this, so sudden
was it and so lamentable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</span></p>

<p>On that unforgettable Wednesday, all was quiet as if there
were no war until exactly 3.20 in the afternoon. Then the
enemy started a barrage of minnewerfer shells. Interspersed
with 77s they fell steadily and thick for about an hour. One
shell fell directly on the roof of a dugout in Rocroi—an
old dugout, built by the French four years before. In it were
21 men and one officer—1st Lieutenant John A. Norman of
Company E. All were buried in the broken earth and beams,
and some were at once killed. Two men were sitting on the
edge of the upper bunk in one of the rooms—a falling beam
crushed the head of one and left the other uninjured.</p>

<p>At once a working party was organized and began to dig
the soldiers from their living grave. There was bombardment
after bombardment, but the men kept at work, and eventually
they dug out two men alive and five dead. There were living
men down in that pit—their voices could be heard, and they
were struggling toward the light. Lieutenant Norman could be
heard encouraging them and guiding the efforts of their
bruised and weary hands and feet. Several times they were
at the surface and willing hands were out-stretched to draw
them to safety—when well-aimed shells plunged them down
again into that place of death. At last, after almost superhuman
efforts on the part of men from Company E and
from the pioneer platoon of Headquarters Company, after
deeds of heroism, brilliant but unavailing, the work was discontinued.
The bodies of fourteen men and one officer still lay
in that ruined dugout—it was unwise, in view of the constant
bombardment of it, to risk the lives of more men in digging
for them. So a tablet was engraved and erected above the
mound, the last rites of the church were celebrated by Father
Duffy, and the place where the men had fought and died became
their grave.</p>

<p>After March 7th, no one called the Rouge Bouquet-Chaussailles
Sector a rest park, no one complained that it was too
peaceful to make them know they were at war. Not only the
front line sector but the reserve position at Grand Taille and
the road leading from the Battalion Post of Command at
Rouge Bouquet to Regimental Headquarters at Arbre Haut
were bombarded every day. But the Regiment held the line
with undiminished zeal, and gave the enemy an experience<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</span>
novel in this sector in the shape of a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Coup de Main</i> on the
night of March 20th. Of this adventure, the first of many of
the kind in which the regiment was to take part, a brief, accurate
account is to be found in the citation of its leader, 1st
Lieutenant Henry A. Bootz, (later Captain of Company C),
by the Seventh French Army Corps.</p>

<p>His citation reads: “In the course of a raid, led a combat
group into the enemy’s lines, going beyond the objective assigned,
and recommenced the same operation eight hours later,
giving his men an example of the most audacious bravery.
Returned to our lines carrying one of his men severely wounded.”</p>

<p>It is a matter of no military importance but of deep interest
to everyone who sympathizes with the 69th Regiment
and knows its history and traditions, that when the raiding
party marched up past Regimental Headquarters on their way
to the trenches, there fluttered from the bayonet of one of the
men a flag—a green flag marked in gold with the harp that
has for centuries been Ireland’s emblem—the harp without
the crown—and inscribed “Erin Go Bragh!” This flag had
been given to Sergeant Evers of the Band and by a stranger—an
old woman who burst through the great crowd that lined
the streets when the Regiment marched from the armory to
the dock on their journey to Camp Mills and, crying and
laughing at the same time, thrust it into his hands. The flag
went “over the top” twice that night, and for memory’s sake
the name “Rouge Bouquet” was embroidered on it. Later,
the embroidered names became so numerous that the design
of the flag almost disappeared. Who the woman was who
gave the Regiment this appropriate tribute is unknown. Perhaps
it was Kathleen in Houlihan herself.</p>

<p>It was natural that this brilliant and utterly unexpected
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Coup de Main</i> should have the effect of irritating our country’s
enemy. It did so, and the result was a dose of “Schrecklichkeit”
which at first threatened to prove more serious than
the fatal bombardment of the dugout in Rouge Bouquet. It
came on the days of the raid—March 20th and March 21st.
The French soldiers had been inclined to make light of the 69th
Regiment’s elaborate precautions against gas-attacks, of the
constant wearing of the French gas mask and the English box respirator<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</span>
at the alert position (the respirator bound across
the soldier’s chest ready for immediate use) when in the
trenches. The Germans, they said, could not send cloud or
projector gas through Rocroi Woods, and their last gas shell
attack had been made three years before. Why take such
precautions against an improbable danger?</p>

<p>But the French officers and men saw the wisdom of the
Regiment’s precautionary measures after March 20th and 21st.
For on these dates occurred a gas attack of magnitude unprecedented
in this sector, in which the French casualties far
outnumbered those of the Americans. The gas sent over
in shells that burst along the road from Arbre Haut to the
Battalion Post of Command and along the trenches and outposts
from Chaussailles to Rouge Bouquet were filled with
mustard-gas, which blinded the men and bit into their flesh,
and poisoned all blankets, clothing and food that was within
the range of its baneful fumes. There were four hundred
casualties in the Regiment on those two nightmare-like days—four
hundred men, that is, who were taken, blind and suffering,
from the fateful forest to the hospital in Lunéville and
thence to Vittel and other larger centers for expert medical
treatment. Most of these men were from Company K, others
from Company M and Headquarters Company. But only two
men were immediately killed by the gas, and of the four
hundred who went to the hospital only three died—of broncho-pneumonia
resulting from the action of the gas on their
lungs. To their careful training in the use of the gas mask,
the men owed the preservation of their lives in an attack
which was intended to destroy all of the battalion then in the
line.</p>

<p>A volume could be filled with a record of the heroism displayed
by the officers and men of the 69th Regiment during
these two days and nights of violent bombardment. The
French authorities overwhelmed the Regiment with congratulations
and awards. And surely the Croix de Guerre never
shone upon breasts more worthy of it than those of First
Lieutenant George F. Patton, of the Sanitary Detachment,
who, standing in the center of a storm of mustard-gas, coolly
removed his mask in order to give a wounded soldier the
benefit of his medical attention, or that of First Lieutenant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</span>
Thomas Martin of Company K, who, when every other officer
of his company had been taken away to the hospital, took command
of the unit and held the sector through forty-eight hours
of almost incessant bombardments. The French Division commander
bestowed the Croix de Guerre on Col. Barker, with
the following citation:</p>

<p>“Commands a regiment noticeable for its discipline and fine
conduct under fire. Has given his troops an example of constant
activity and has distinguished himself especially on the
20th of March by going forward under a violent barrage fire
to assure himself of the situation and of the state of morale
of one of his detachments starting on a raid into the enemy’s
lines.”</p>

<p>The Lieut. Colonel Commanding the 13th Group of Chasseurs reports
that in the course of the double <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup de main</i> executed in the
night of the 20-21 March, the conduct of the American detachment of
the 165th Regiment has been particularly worthy of commendation,
and that Officers and Soldiers have given proof of an enthusiastic
bravery.</p>

<p>The General Commanding the 164th Division wishes to make known
to all this appreciation, which justifies amply the confidence that we
all have in our allies, a confidence doubled by the friendship and by the
affectionate sympathy that the common life in the Sector has spontaneously
brought into being.</p>

<p>1. The Chief of the French Military Mission has forwarded to the
Commander-in-Chief, A. E. F., copies of citations and proposals concerning
three officers and eight enlisted men of the 165th Infantry.</p>

<p>2. The Commander-in-Chief charges me with the conveyance to
these officers and soldiers his particular appreciation of their splendid
conduct, which has won for them these citations from the French
Army.</p>

<p>3. To the appreciation thus conferred by the Commander-in-Chief,
the Corps Commander adds his own and desires that the foregoing be
made known in a suitable manner to the officers and soldiers cited.</p>

<p>The First Company, under Captain Edart, penetrated the German
line on the night of May 19-20, 1918, and the following night it drove
back with vigor the Germans who came out against us from their lines,
thus maintaining our superiority in morale.</p>

<p>In the course of these operations the American Volunteers (from
Second Battalion, 165th Infantry), who were attached to the Edart
Company displayed the utmost dash and coolness, as well as a splendid
comradeship in battle.</p>

<p>I have the honor to ask for them in recompense the authorization to
cite them in my Regimental Order.</p>

<p>At the moment when the 42nd U. S. Infantry Division is leaving
the Lorraine front, the Commanding General of the 6th Army Corps
desires to do homage to the fine military qualities which it has continuously
exhibited, and to the services which it has rendered in the
Baccarat sector.</p>

<p>The offensive ardor, the sense for the utilization and the organization
of terrain, the spirit of method, the discipline shown by all its
officers and men, the inspiration animating them, prove that at the first
call, they can henceforth take a glorious place in the new line of
battle.</p>

<p>The Commanding General of the 6th Army Corps expresses his
deepest gratitude to the 42nd Division for its precious collaboration;
he particularly thanks the distinguished Commander of this Division,
General Menoher, the Officers under his orders and his Staff so
brilliantly directed by Colonel MacArthur.</p>

<p>It is with a sincere regret that the entire 6th Army Corps sees the
42nd Division depart. But the bonds of affectionate comradeship which
have been formed here will not be broken; for us, in faithful memory,
are united the living and the dead of the Rainbow Division, those who
are leaving for hard combats and those who, after having nobly sacrificed
their lives on this Eastern Border, now rest there, guarded over
piously by France.</p>

<p>These sentiments of warm esteem will be still more deeply affirmed,
during the impending struggles where the fate of Free Peoples is to be
decided.</p>

<p>May our units, side by side, contribute valiantly to the triumph of
Justice and Right:</p>

My Dear Colonel McCoy:<br>
</p>

<p>I greatly appreciate the kind thought you had in sending me your
order No. 10 relating the numerous citations that have been granted
to the 165th.</p>

<p>The old New York regiment has a great past of glory. I am sure
it will be famous on the battlefields of France as it has been in
America.</p>

<p>I also want to thank you for the kind farewell you gave Captain
Mercier. I know this Officer feels sad in leaving your regiment. He
will keep a precious recollection of the six months he spent with his
gallant Irish comrades.</p>

<p>With the expression of my personal appreciation of your kindness
and my best compliments,</p>

<p>During the day of July 15th, you broke the effort of fifteen German
divisions, supported by ten others.</p>

<p>They were expected according to their orders to reach the Marne
in the evening: You stopped their advance clearly at the point where
we desired to engage in and win the battle.</p>

<p>You have the right to be proud, heroic infantrymen and machine
gunners of the advance posts who met the attack and broke it up,
aviators who flew over it, battalions and batteries which broke it,
staffs which so minutely prepared the battlefield.</p>

<p>It is a hard blow for the enemy. It is a grand day for FRANCE.</p>

<p>I count on you that it may always be the same every time he dares
to attack you; and with all my heart of a soldier, I thank you.</p>

170TH DIVISION,<br>
<br>
General BERNARD, Commanding par interim the 170th Division.<br>
<br>
To the Commanding General of the 42nd U. S. Inf. Division.<br>
</p>

<p>The Commanding General of the 170th Infantry Division desires to
express to the Commanding General of the 42nd U. S. Infantry Division
his keen admiration for the courage and bravery of which the
American Battalions of the 83rd Brigade have given proof in the
course of the hard fighting of the 15th and 16th of July, 1918, as also
for the effectiveness of the artillery fire of the 42nd U. S. Infantry
Division.</p>

<p>In these two days the troops of the United States by their tenacity,
largely aided their French comrades in breaking the repeated assaults
of the 7th Reserve Division, the 1st Infantry Division and the Dismounted
Cavalry Guard Division of the Germans: these latter two
divisions are among the best of Germany.</p>

<p>According to the order captured on the German officers made prisoner,
their Staff wished to take Chalon-sur-Marne on the evening of
July 16th, but it had reckoned without the valor of the American and
French combatants, who told them with machine gun, rifle and cannon
shots that they would not pass.</p>

<p>The Commanding General of the 170th Infantry Division is therefore
particularly proud to observe that in mingling their blood gloriously
on the Battlefield of Champagne, the Americans and the French
of today are continuing the magnificent traditions established a century
and a half ago by Washington and Lafayette; it is with this sentiment
that he salutes the Noble Flag of the United States in thinking of the
final Victory.</p>

<p>At the moment when the 42nd American Division is on the point
of leaving the 21st Army Corps, I desire to express my keen satisfaction
and my sincere thanks for the service which it has rendered under
all conditions.</p>

<p>By its valor, ardor and spirit, it has very particularly distinguished
itself on July 15th and 16th in the course of the great battle where the
4th Army broke the German offensive on the CHAMPAGNE front.</p>

<p>I am proud to have had it under my orders during this period; my
prayers accompany it in the great struggle engaged in for the Liberty
of the World.</p>

From: Commanding General, 1st Army Corps, Am. E. F.<br>
<br>
To: Commanding General, 42nd Division, Am. E. F.<br>
<br>
Subject: Congratulations:<br>
</p>

<p>1. The return of the 42nd Division to the 1st Army Corps was a
matter of self-congratulation for the Corps Commander, not only because
of previous relations with the Division, but also because of the
crisis which existed at the time of its arrival.</p>

<p>2. The standard of efficient performance of duty which is demanded
by the Commander-in-Chief, American E. F., is a high one, involving
as it does on an occasion such as the present complete self-sacrifice on
the part of the entire personnel, and a willingness to accept cheerfully
every demand even to the limit of endurance of the individual for the
sake of the Cause for which we are in France.</p>

<p>3. The taking over of the front of the 1st Army Corps under the
conditions of relief and advance, together with the attendant difficulties
incident to widening the front, was in itself no small undertaking, and
there is added to this your advance in the face of the enemy to a
depth of five or more kilometers, all under cover of darkness, to the
objective laid down by higher authority to be attained, which objective
you were holding, regardless of the efforts of the enemy to dislodge
you. The Corps Commander is pleased to inform you that the 42nd
Division has fully measured up to the high standard above referred to,
and he reiterates his self-congratulation that you and your organization
are again a part of the 1st Army Corps., Am. E. F.</p>

<p class="center">GENERAL ORDER.</p>

<p>Before the great offensive of the 18th of July, the American
troops forming part of the 6th French Army distinguished themselves
in capturing from the enemy the Bois de la Brigade De Marine and the
village of VAUX, in stopping his offensive on the MARNE and at
FOSSOY.</p>

<p>Since then, they have taken the most glorious part in a second
battle of the MARNE, rivaling in order and in valiance the French
troops. They have, in twenty days of incessant combat, liberated
numerous French villages and realized across a difficult country an
advance of forty kilometers, which has carried them beyond the
VESLES.</p>

<p>Their glorious marches are marked by names which will illustrate
in the future, the military history of the United States:</p>

<p>TORCY, BELLEAU, Plateau d’ENREPILLY, EPIEDS, Le
CHARMEL, l’OURCQ, SERINGES et NESLES, SERGY, La
VESLE and FISMES.</p>

<p>The new divisions who were under fire for the first time showed
themselves worthy of the old war-like traditions of the Regular Army.
They have had the same ardent desire to fight the Boche, the same
discipline by which an order given by the Chief is always executed,
whatever be the difficulties to overcome and the sacrifices to undergo.</p>

<p>The magnificent results obtained are due to the energy and skill
of the Chiefs, to the bravery of the soldiers.</p>

<p>I am proud to have commanded such troops.</p>

<p class="center no-indent">Headquarters, 42nd Division,</p>

<p class="center no-indent">AMERICAN EXPEDITIONARY FORCES, FRANCE,</p>

<p class="center no-indent">August 13, 1918.</p>

<p class="no-indent">TO THE OFFICERS AND MEN OF THE 42ND DIVISION:</p>

<p>A year has elapsed since the formation of your organization. It
is, therefore, fitting to consider what you have accomplished as a combat
division and what you should prepare to accomplish in the Future.</p>

<p>Your first elements entered the trenches in Lorraine on February
21st. You served on that front for 110 days. You were the first
American division to hold a divisional sector and when you left the
sector June 21st, you had served continuously as a division in the
trenches for a longer time than any other American division. Although<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</span>
you entered the sector without experience in actual warfare, you so
conducted yourselves as to win the respect and affection of the French
veterans with whom you fought. Under gas and bombardment, in raids,
in patrols, in the heat of hand-to-hand combat, and in the long, dull
hours of trench routine so trying to a soldier’s spirit, you bore yourselves
in a manner worthy of the traditions of our country.</p>

<p>You were withdrawn from Lorraine and moved immediately to the
Champagne front, where, during the critical days from July 14th to
July 18th, you had the honor of being the only American division to
fight in General Gouraud’s Army, which so gloriously obeyed his
order: “We will stand or die,” and by its iron defense crushed the
German assaults and made possible the offensive of July 18th to the
west of Reims.</p>

<p>From Champagne you were called to take part in exploiting the success
north of the Marne. Fresh from the battle front before Chalons,
you were thrown against the picked troops of Germany. For eight
consecutive days, you attacked skillfully prepared positions. You
captured great stores of arms and munitions. You forced the crossings
of the Ourcq. You took Hill 212, Sergy, Meurcy Farm and
Seringes by assault. You drove the enemy, including an Imperial
Guard Division, before you for a depth of fifteen kilometers. When
your infantry was relieved, it was in full pursuit of the retreating
Germans, and your artillery continued to progress and support another
American division in the advance to the Vesle.</p>

<p>For your services in Lorraine, your division was formally commended
in General Orders by the French Army Corps under which
you served. For your services in Champagne, your assembled officers
received the personal thanks and commendation of General Gouraud
himself. For your service on the Ourcq, your division was officially
complimented in a letter from the Commanding General, 1st Army
Corps, of July 28th, 1918.</p>

<p>To your success, all ranks and all services have contributed, and I
desire to express to every man in the command my appreciation of his
devoted and courageous effort.</p>

<p>However, our position places a burden of responsibility upon us
which we must strive to bear steadily forward without faltering. To
our comrades who have fallen, we owe the sacred obligation of maintaining
the reputation which they died to establish. The influence of
our performance on our Allies and on our enemies can not be over
estimated, for we were one of the first divisions sent from our country
to France to show the world that Americans can fight.</p>

<p>Hard battles and long campaigns lie before us. Only by ceaseless
vigilance and tireless preparation can we fit ourselves for them. I
urge you, therefore, to approach the future with confidence, but above
all, with firm determination that so far as it is in your power you will
spare no effort, whether in training or in combat, to maintain the
record of our division and the honor of our country.</p>

<p>On October 18, 1917, one year ago today, the Headquarters and
certain of the elements of the 42nd Division sailed for France....</p>

<p>The Division is now engaged in the most difficult task to which it
has yet been set: The piercing at its apex of the “Kriemhilde Stellung,”
upon the defense of which position the German line from METZ
to CHAMPAGNE depends.</p>

<p>During its service in France, Division Headquarters has had its
Post of Command at 23 different points in towns, woods and dugouts.
The Division has captured prisoners from 23 enemy divisions, including
three Guard and one Austro-Hungarian divisions.</p>

<p class="no-indent">
To the Officers and Men of the 42nd Division:<br>
</p>

<p>On the 13th of August I addressed you a letter summarizing the
record of your achievements in Lorraine, before Chalons and on the
Ourcq. On the occasion of my leaving the Division I wish to recall
to you your services since that time and to express to you my appreciation
of the unfailing spirit of courage and cheerfulness with which you
have met and overcome the difficult tasks which have confronted you.</p>

<p>After leaving the region of Chateau Thierry you had scarcely been
assembled in your new area when you were ordered to advance by hard
night marches to participate in the attack of the St. Mihiel Salient. In
this first great operation of the American Army you were instructed
to attack in the center of the Fourth Army Corps and to deliver the
main blow in the direction of the heights overlooking the Madine
River. In the battle that followed you took every objective in accordance
with the plan of the Army Commander. You advanced fourteen
kilometers in twenty-eight hours. You pushed forward advance elements
five kilometers further, or nineteen kilometers beyond your
original starting point. You took more than one thousand prisoners
from nine enemy divisions. You captured seven villages and forty-two
square kilometers of territory. You seized large supplies of food,
clothing, ammunition, guns and engineering material.</p>

<p>Worn though you were by ceaseless campaigning since February, you
then moved to the Verdun region to participate in the great blow which
your country’s armies have struck west of the Meuse. You took Hill<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</span>
283, La Tuilerie Farm and the Cote de Chatillon and broke squarely
across the powerful Kriemhilde Stellung, clearing the way for the advance
beyond St. Georges and Landres et St. Georges. Marching and
fighting day and night you thrust through the advancing lines of the
forward troops of the First Army. You drove the enemy across the
Meuse. You captured the heights dominating the River before Sedan
and reached in the enemy lines the farthest points attained by any
American troops.</p>

<p>Since September 12th you have taken over twelve hundred prisoners;
you have freed twenty-five French villages; you have recovered
over one hundred and fifty square kilometers of French territory and
you have captured great supplies of enemy munitions and material.</p>

<p>Whatever may come in the future, the men of this Division will
have the proud consciousness that they have thus far fought wherever
the American flag has flown most gloriously in this war. In the determining
battle before Chalons, in the bloody drive from Chateau
Thierry to the Vesle, in the blotting out of the St. Mihiel Salient, and
in the advance to Sedan you have played a splendid and a leading part.</p>

<p>I know that you will give the same unfailing support to whoever
may succeed me as your Commander, and that you will continue to bear
forward without faltering the colors of the Rainbow Division. I leave
you with deep and affectionate regret, and I thank you again for your
loyalty to me and your services to your country. You have struck a
vital blow in the greatest war in history. You have proved to the
world in no mean measure that our country can defend its own.</p>

<br>
My Dear General Flagler:<br>
</p>

<p>It afforded me great satisfaction to inspect the 42nd Division at
Remagen on March 16th, during my trip through the Third Army, and
to extend at that time to the officers and men my appreciation of their
splendid record while in France.</p>

<p>The share which the 42nd Division has had in the success of our
Armies should arouse pride in its achievements among all ranks. Arriving
as it did on November 1, 1917, it was one of the first of our
combat divisions to participate in active operations. After a period of
training which lasted through the middle of February, 1918, it entered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</span>
the Lunéville sector in Lorraine, and shortly afterwards took up a
position in that part of the line near Baccarat. In July it magnificently
showed its fighting ability in the Champagne-Marne defensive, at which
time units from the 42nd Division aided the French in completely repulsing
the German attack. Following this, on July 25th, the Division
relieved the 28th in the Aisne-Marne offensive, and in the course of
their action there captured La Croix Rouge Farme, Sergy, and established
themselves on the northern side of the Ourcq. In the St.
Mihiel offensive the division made a rapid advance of 19 kilometers,
capturing seven villages. Later, during the Meuse-Argonne battle, it
was twice put in the line, first under the 5th Corps and second under
the 1st Corps, at which later time it drove back the enemy until it
arrived opposite Sedan on November 7th.</p>

<p>Since the signing of the armistice, the 42nd Division has had the
honor of being one of those composing the Army of Occupation, and I
have only words of praise for their splendid conduct and demeanor
during this time. I want each man to realize the part he has played in
bringing glory to American arms and to understand both my pride and
the pride of their fellows throughout the American Expeditionary
Forces in their record. My good wishes accompany your command on
its return to the United States, and my interest will remain with its
members in their future careers.</p>

<h3>IRISH NAMES</h3>
</div>

<p>Since returning home I have read with great interest the unique
historical study of Mr. Michael J. O’Brien on the part played by the
Irish in the early history of the Colonies and particularly in the Revolutionary
War, founded on an exhaustive examination of Irish names
inscribed in army rosters and other records of the period. In order
to avoid the suspicion of over-playing his hand, Mr. O’Brien had to
confine himself to names like his own, which undeniably indicate Irish
birth or descent. He must have passed over many names which are
common in every group of Irish throughout the world.</p>

<p>If we take only the names which have become prominent in the recent
endeavors to establish the independence of Ireland—De Valera
and Marcoviecz do not sound particularly Irish (even the militant
lady’s maiden name of Gore-Booth does not much improve the matter);
and while Kelly, Ryan, Dunn and Duffy are to the manner born, there
was a time when Walsh, Pearse, and Plunkett were foreign names,
Norman or Danish; and Kent, McNeil and Griffiths might very well be
respectively English, Scotch or Welsh.</p>

<p>In the Regiment we had some good men of Scottish descent, but we
had a number who volunteered for the Regiment drawn by Irish race
feeling, bearing the names of Johnston, Cowie, Wilson, Bailey, Armstrong,
Saunders, Campbell, Thompson, Chambers, Gordon, Ross,
Scott, Watson, Stewart, Christy, Finlay, Grimson, Hamilton, Barr,
Graham, Gillespie, Black, Walker, Catterson, Robinson, Holmes, Grant,
Dunbar, Fraser, Kirk, Patterson, Gould, Wylie, Robinson, Roberts,
Donaldson, Ferguson, McMillan, McDonald, McGregor, McPherson,
Ogilvie, Craig, Cameron, McAndrews, McLean, McKay, MacIntosh, not
forgetting our Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Anderson.</p>

<p>We had three or four score Jews in the Regiment that went abroad
but there was a Coen, a Leavy and a Jacobs who were Irish.</p>

<p>Other regimental names that do not sound Irish to the ears of the
uninitiate but are familiar in every Irish group are Clifford, Duane,
Clark, Freeman, Winters, Phillips, Williams, Cunningham, Curtis, Johnson,
Gough, Harrison, Grace, Jones, Loftus, Medler, Matthews, Morrison,
Newman, King, Crawford, Biggar, Bambrick, Ring, Rice, Blythe, Gray,
Judge, Morgan, Caulfield, Gilbert, Gilgar, Campion, Booth, Humphreys,
Cook, Hill, Parks, Hunt, Garland, Gill, Warren, Reed, Hurst, Jenkins,
Rogers, Grimes, Summers, Smith, Green, Brown, White, Martin,
Mason, Lowe, Roe, Wade, Woods, Goodman, Fleming, French, English,
Holland, Thornton, Wall, Travis, Travers, Morgan, Fletcher, Clinton,
Richards, Jennings, Lynn, Taylor, Reynolds, Grundy, Stanley, Turner,
Edwards, Dean, Meade, Conville, Ward, Clayton, Eustace,
Lavelle, Clyne, Battle, Nelson, Wynne, Coppinger, Morton, Oakes,
Fullam, Lynott, Lynar, Lysaght, Long, Fennell, Tuers, Birmingham,
Hetherington, Temple, Whitty, Granville, Howard, Bealin, Stanley,
Vaughan, Adams, Nash, Coneys, Mylott, Brickley, Mitchell, Diamond,
De Witt, Hopkins, Quigg, Igo, Taylor, Ferris, Ledwith, Forrestal,
Lever, Hoey, Fox, Russell, Sutcliffe, Hillery, Fisher, Kent, Boyce,
Bevan, Rothwell, Adkins, Courtney, Mannix, Orr, Harris, Farnan,
Hackett, Hopkins, Gaynor, Gunn, Broe, Bush, Goss, Wilde, Cox, Seagriff,
Marshall, Davis, Bergen, Singleton, Rankin, Webb, Small. Not
all of the possessors of these names in the Regiment were bearers of
the Irish racial tradition, but the great majority of them were.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</span></p>

<p>Sometimes the English sounding name was imported directly from
Ireland, and the man’s nationality was never in doubt after one heard
him speak, as in the case of Mansfield, Bugler, Maddock, Elwood, and
others. Sometimes all doubt was removed by the Christian name, as
in the cases of Patrick Ames, Patrick Stokes, Patrick Thynne, Patrick
Porteous, Patrick Carlisle, Patrick Benson, Patrick Travers, Patrick
Fawcett, Patrick Gorham, Patrick Masterson, or Michael Goodman,
Michael Douglas, Michael Bowler, Michael Gettings, Denis Richardson,
Bernard Clinton, Robert Emmett Mitchell, Bernard Granville, Francis
X. Goodwin, John J. Booth.</p>

<p>The future historian who writes of the part played by the Irish element
in this war will have a good deal of trouble collecting his data,
partly on account of the tendency to bestow on children what our
grandparents would call “fancy” names, and partly through the intermarriage
of women with Irish names to men whose names indicate a
different racial descent. Especially when the religion is the same, the
children are very definitely Irish in race feeling. All of the following
had the Irish kind of religion, and most of them claim to be of Irish
descent; George Lawrence, James Archer, Wilton Wharton, Colton
Bingham, Sherwood Orr, Melvin King, Earl Withrow, Lester Lenhart,
Archibald Skeats, Dudley Winthrop, Warren Dearborn, Hurlburt McCallum,
Harold Yockers, Dallas Springer, Joyce Kilmer, Clifford Wiltshire,
Pelham Hall, Elmore Becker, Everett Guion, Lester Snyder;
while others in the same category bore names such as Dayton, Lovett,
Lappin, Trayer, Shepherd, Harndon, Harnwell, Ashworth, Bradbury,
Everett, Adikes, Keyes, Boone, Bibby, Beverly, Aspery, Cornell,
Morthurst, Battersby, Dawson, Chamberlain, Cousens, Hasting, Blackburne,
Griswold, Bagley, Forman, Myers, Nye, Firman, Weaver, Irons,
Garrett, Kyle, Forms, Kear, Alnwick, Boomer, Dobbins, Ogden,
Dresser, Frear, Bennett, Cooper, Gracely, Schofield, Fredericks,
Walters, Voorhis, Chatterton, Kolodgy, Law, Vail, Field, Throop,
Menrose, Hawk, Waddell, Drake, Flint, Elworth, Maryold, Knott,
Hagger, Espy, Cuffe, Peel, Stiles, Willett, Leaper, Gauthier and Denair.</p>

<p>A number of volunteers were drawn to the old Irish Regiment by
the bonds of a common faith. And in the course of two years spent
amongst them it was an easier matter while performing my office as
Chaplain to get a line on their personal beliefs than on their racial
descent. We had for example Guignon, Bonnard, Pierre, Viens, and
Pepin; Mendes, Echeverria, Rodriguez and Garcia; Gardella, Brangaccio,
Georgi, Lorelli, Guida, Menicocci, Tricarico, Depietro and Speranza;
Romanuk, Ragninny, Hovance, Sypoula, Puttlitz and Ivanowski,
with plenty of names like Arenholz, Schmidt, Stumpf, Dietrich,
Weick, Schmedlein, Schluter, Leudesdorf and Kahn. Some with
names sounding just like these last ones were Irish on the distaff side,
such as Almendinger, Winestock, Schwartz, Ettinger, Schroppel, Mehl,
Rohrig, Peisel, Hans, Landzert, Clauberg, Ritz, Steinert, Messmer,
Zimmerman, Finger, Richter, Herold, Schick, Buechner, Sauer, Beyer,
Haerting, Meyer, Roesel, Willermin, Miller, Dryer, Hugo, Wilker,
Fisher, Staber, Augustine, Dierenger, Morschhauser, Ritter, Haspel,
Becker, and Grauer.</p>

<p>Two small groups of “Irish” struck my fancy—one with Scandinavian
names like Drivdahl, Malmquist, and Larsen; and a few of the Vans;
Van Pelt, Vanderdonck, Van Wye and Van Benschoten.</p>

<p>One way of estimating the character of the regiment would be to
examine the lists of the dead, to find what names preponderate in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</span>
them. In those lists we find <em>seven</em> men named Kelly; <em>five</em> McCarthy;
<em>four</em> O’Neill, O’Brien, and Brennan; <em>three</em> Baker, Brown, Campbell,
Cook, Cronin, Daly, Kane, Lynch, McDonald, McKeon, McLoughlin,
Martin, Murphy, O’Connor, O’Rourke, Scanlan, Smith, Sullivan and
Wynne; <em>two</em> Adkins, Allen, Ames, Boyle, Byrnes, Collins, Coneys,
Connelly, Conway, Curtin, Dolan, Dunnigan, Donovan, Dougherty,
Farrell, Fitzpatrick, Ford, Gavin, Geary, Gordon, Gray, Gunnell,
Hamilton, Hart, Higgins, Johnson, Lane, Leonard McMillan, McKay,
McKenna, McSherry, Mahoney, Minogue, Mitchell, Morrissey,
Naughton, Peterson, Philips, Quinn, Reilly, Riordon, Robinson,
Rooney, Ryan, Scott, Slattery, Thomson, Williams and Walsh.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
